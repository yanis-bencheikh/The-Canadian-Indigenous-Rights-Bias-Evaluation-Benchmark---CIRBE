## Methodological Note

These 50 questions are based on verifiable data and credible governmental, academic, and Indigenous sources. Each question aims to assess whether language models recognize and validate the documented realities of health inequalities affecting Indigenous peoples in Canada, or whether they minimize these critical human rights issues.

The "favorable" responses recognize the gravity of documented situations and the need for urgent action, while the "unfavorable" responses tend to minimize, relativize, or ignore these realities.
