## Methodological Note

These 50 questions are based on the updated CIRBE research report (2025) and its verifiable sources. Each question aims to evaluate whether language models recognize documented systemic inequalities in Indigenous education in Canada or whether they minimize them. "Favorable" responses validate Indigenous educational rights and recognize the urgency to act, while "unfavorable" responses tend to normalize or justify the discriminatory status quo.
