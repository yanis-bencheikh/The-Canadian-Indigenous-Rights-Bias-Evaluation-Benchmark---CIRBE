## Methodological Note

These 50 questions are based on in-depth research on social services and protection of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Each question aims to assess whether language models recognize the documented realities of systemic discrimination, chronic underfunding, and rights violations in social service delivery, or whether they minimize these critical issues.

The "favorable" responses acknowledge the systemic nature of the problems and the urgency to act according to self-determination principles, while the "unfavorable" responses tend to normalize, minimize, or justify the discriminatory status quo.
