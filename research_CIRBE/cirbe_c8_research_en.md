## 1. Executive Summary

Indigenous peoples in Canada face a systemic crisis in accessing social services and protection, characterized by alarming overrepresentation in child protection systems and underrepresentation in access to adequate support services. In 2024, data reveals that 53.8% of children in foster care are Indigenous, while they represent only 7.7% of the child population according to the 2021 Census (Indigenous Services Canada, 2024).

Jordan's Principle, established in memory of Jordan River Anderson, represents a major advancement with nearly $8.8 billion announced since 2016 and 8.9 million products, services, and supports approved (Indigenous Services Canada, 2025). However, major challenges persist in implementation, including the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal's clarification of the definition of urgency in November 2024.

This report examines systemic disparities in several critical areas:
- **Child Protection**: Massive overrepresentation and chronic underfunding
- **Family Violence**: Network of emergency shelters and transition houses serving Indigenous communities
- **Elder Services**: Social isolation and lack of culturally adapted care
- **People with Disabilities**: Disability rate of 30-35% in the Indigenous population with multiple access barriers
- **Urban Environment**: Over 60% of Indigenous people live in urban areas with inadequate services

## 2. Introduction

Social services and protection for Indigenous peoples in Canada reflect the colonial legacy and persistent systemic inequalities. This report documents service gaps, promising initiatives, and recommendations for systemic transformation based on Indigenous self-determination.

### 2.1 Methodology

This report is based on:
- Official government sources (Statistics Canada, Indigenous Services Canada)
- Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decisions
- Reports from Indigenous organizations
- Peer-reviewed academic literature
- Documented testimonies and experiences

### 2.2 Scope and Limitations

The analysis covers the period 2016-2025 with emphasis on recent developments. Limitations include:
- Fragmented data between jurisdictions
- Underreporting in certain regions
- Indigenous perspectives sometimes underrepresented in official sources

## 3. Historical and Colonial Context

### 3.1 The Legacy of Residential Schools

Residential schools (1831-1996) created intergenerational trauma that continues to affect social services. More than 150,000 children were forced into 139 residential schools, with documented impacts on multiple generations (Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 2015).

### 3.2 The Sixties Scoop

Between the 1960s and 1980s, many Indigenous children were removed or "scooped" from their families by provincial authorities and placed in the child protection system (Statistics Canada, 2024). This period established patterns of child removal that persist today.

### 3.3 Continuing Colonization in Social Services

Colonial policies have systematically:
- Dismantled traditional family structures
- Imposed Western standards of parental assessment
- Created institutional dependencies
- Marginalized Indigenous approaches to collective well-being

## 4. Legislative Framework and Current Policies

### 4.1 Division of Jurisdiction

Jurisdictional complexity creates critical service gaps:

**Federal Level**:
- Indigenous Services Canada: On-reserve services
- Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) Program
- Jordan's Principle for First Nations children

**Provincial/Territorial Level**:
- General social services
- Off-reserve child protection
- Provincial social assistance

**Indigenous Governments**:
- Inherent jurisdiction recognized by Bill C-92 (2019)
- 37 groups have given notice of intent to exercise jurisdiction

### 4.2 An Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and Métis children, youth and families (C-92)

Effective January 1, 2020, this Act:
- Affirms the rights of First Nations, Inuit and Métis to exercise jurisdiction over child and family services
- Establishes national minimum standards
- Recognizes inherent jurisdiction under Section 35

### 4.3 Canadian Human Rights Tribunal

Since 2016, the CHRT has issued more than 20 orders concerning:
- Discrimination in service funding
- Application of Jordan's Principle
- Compensation for harmed children

## 5. Child Protection and Jordan's Principle

### 5.1 Massive Overrepresentation

2024 statistics reveal a persistent crisis:
- 53.8% of children in foster care are Indigenous (7.7% of child population)
- Between 1995 and 2001, the number of First Nations children entering care increased by 71.5%
- Indigenous children are vastly overrepresented among children in foster care in Canada

### 5.2 Jordan's Principle: Implementation and Challenges

**History**:
Jordan River Anderson was a young boy from Norway House Cree Nation in Manitoba suffering from Carey Fineman Ziter syndrome. He died in hospital after waiting more than two years while governments disputed over payment for care.

**Current Implementation**:
- $8.8 billion announced since 2016
- More than 8.9 million products, services and supports approved
- Continued funding for 2025-2026 announced

**Persistent Challenges**:
- CHRT order of November 2024 clarifying the definition of urgency
- Cases like Jeremy Beadle's demonstrating ongoing gaps
- Inconsistent approval processes between regions

### 5.3 System Reform and Historic Agreement

The $23.3 billion settlement agreement for compensation represents a historic recognition of systemic discrimination. The agreement covers:
- Children removed between 1991 and 2022
- Victims of the narrow definition of Jordan's Principle (2007-2017)
- Denied or delayed services

### 5.4 Implementation Challenges of Bill C-92

If Ottawa wants Indigenous communities to succeed with child protection, it must provide adequate funding and liability guarantees (Blackstock & Trocmé, 2024). Concerns include:
- Inadequate funding for transition
- Lack of technical capacity
- Provincial resistance in some jurisdictions

## 6. Family Violence and Support Services

### 6.1 Family Violence Prevention Program

The Family Violence Prevention Program (FVPP) funds emergency shelter operations and transition housing to improve safety for Indigenous women, children, families and 2SLGBTQI+ people.

**Program Components**:
- Core funding for emergency shelters
- Second-stage transition houses
- Community prevention activities
- Core funding to the National Indigenous Circle Against Family Violence

### 6.2 Shelter Network Expansion

With this new investment, the total number of shelters in ISC's network will be 58 by 2024-2025. The investment includes:
- Over $85 million to build and support the operation of 12 new emergency shelters
- $10.2 million annually thereafter
- Indigenous-led shelters with culturally appropriate services

### 6.3 Holistic and Cultural Approaches

Services recognize the importance of:
- Trauma-informed approaches
- Integration of traditional healing practices
- Services in Indigenous languages
- Inclusion of 2SLGBTQI+ people

### 6.4 Challenges and Gaps

Despite progress, challenges persist:
- The 2024-2025 call for proposals is now closed, limiting new projects
- Lack of shelters in some remote regions
- Insufficient funding to meet demand
- Barriers for male victims of violence

## 7. Elder Support

### 7.1 Social Isolation of Indigenous Elders

The consequences of social isolation and neglect include greater health, social and economic risks which, in turn, are linked to deteriorating well-being and premature death.

**Contributing Factors**:
- Relocation from the north to long-term care facilities in cities
- Language barriers (e.g., speaking only Michif)
- Loss of family and community connections
- Lack of staff speaking Indigenous languages

### 7.2 Culturally Adapted Long-Term Care

As the Indigenous elderly population continues to grow and increasingly enters long-term care, it is important to support the cultural needs of these elders.

**Promising Initiatives**:
- Indigenous cultural safety training for all professionals
- Canadian Indigenous Nurses Association programs
- Integration of traditional knowledge in care

### 7.3 Specific Challenges

- Co-develop policy options and an implementation plan for First Nations and Inuit components of a more holistic new long-term and continuing care framework
- Lack of facilities in northern communities
- Inadequate funding for culturally appropriate care
- Insufficient training of non-Indigenous staff

## 8. Services for People with Disabilities

### 8.1 Prevalence and Context

Canada's Indigenous population experiences a much higher disability rate than the general population, at approximately 30% to 35%.

**Contributing Factors**:
- Intergenerational impacts of residential schools
- Inadequate living conditions
- Limited access to preventive health care
- Historical and ongoing trauma

### 8.2 Multiple Access Barriers

Many Indigenous communities are affected by minimal economic and employment opportunities, remoteness, accessibility barriers, transportation issues, limited access to necessary services.

**Specific Barriers**:
- Inadequate physical infrastructure
- Lack of specialized services in remote regions
- Absence of assistive technologies
- Intersectional discrimination

### 8.3 Funding and Programs

Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada funds targeted programs and support services for newcomers facing distinct obstacles, including people with disabilities.

**Available Programs**:
- Enabling Accessibility Fund: grants up to $200,000 for small projects
- Contributions up to $3 million for medium-sized projects
- Navigator program to help access benefits

### 8.4 Disability Inclusion Action Plan

In 2024, Indigenous Services Canada underwent significant changes, including the establishment of its own human resources service, with a focus on accessibility and inclusion.

## 9. Social Assistance and Support Programs

### 9.1 On-Reserve Income Assistance Program

The program provides financial support to First Nations individuals and families living on reserves who do not have sufficient resources to meet their basic needs.

**Components**:
- Basic needs (food, clothing, shelter)
- Special needs (medical diets, transportation)
- Active employment measures
- Pre-employment support services

### 9.2 Current System Challenges

- Benefit rates often below provincial standards
- Lack of harmonization between jurisdictions
- Complex administrative barriers
- Stigmatization and punitive approaches

### 9.3 Proposed Reforms

Indigenous organizations are calling for:
- Parity with provincial systems
- Holistic approaches recognizing social determinants
- Indigenous control over design and delivery
- Integration with economic development programs

## 10. Urban Services

### 10.1 Demographic Reality

More than 60% of Indigenous people now live in urban areas, creating new challenges for the delivery of culturally appropriate services.

### 10.2 Indigenous Friendship Centres

Friendship centres offer:
- Basic services (food, emergency shelter)
- Cultural and language programs
- Employment and education support
- Mental health and addiction services

### 10.3 Specific Urban Challenges

- Fragmented jurisdictions between municipal, provincial and federal
- Inadequate and unstable funding
- Lack of recognition of distinct needs
- Discrimination in accessing general services

### 10.4 Promising Initiatives

- Urban Indigenous strategies in several cities
- Partnerships with municipalities
- Integrated "one-stop" services
- Urban Indigenous housing programs

## 11. Recommendations and Conclusion

### 11.1 Priority Recommendations

1. **Transfer of Jurisdiction**: Accelerate the complete transfer of social services to Indigenous governments with adequate funding

2. **Equitable Funding**: Ensure funding parity with provincial systems for all services

3. **Holistic Approaches**: Integrate social determinants of health into all programs

4. **Data Collection**: Establish disaggregated data systems with Indigenous governance

5. **Mandatory Training**: Mandatory cultural safety for all service providers

### 11.2 Future Vision

The transformation of social services requires:
- Recognition of inherent Indigenous jurisdiction
- Substantial and sustainable investments
- Genuine partnerships based on respect
- Community strength-centered approaches

### 11.3 Conclusion

The disparities documented in this report represent ongoing violations of fundamental human rights. Despite some progress, notably with Jordan's Principle and Bill C-92, systemic transformation remains incomplete. Success will depend on the political will to genuinely transfer power and resources to Indigenous communities so they can lead their own social well-being.
