## 1. Executive Summary

The culture and identity of Indigenous peoples in Canada face persistent systemic challenges stemming from centuries of colonization and assimilationist policies. This report documents critical issues in six interconnected areas:

**Key Findings**:
- Gender-based discrimination in the Indian Act persists despite amendments in 1985 (Bill C-31), 2011 (C-3) and 2019 (S-3), creating a "hierarchy" of status that divides families and communities¹
- Thousands of cultural objects and ancestral remains remain in Canadian and international museums, with no national legislative framework for their repatriation²
- Canadian media perpetuate harmful stereotypes, with only 4 Indigenous characters out of 121 in children's animation³
- Chronic underfunding of Indigenous sports programs persists despite Truth and Reconciliation Commission calls to action⁴
- Indigenous arts receive disproportionately low funding compared to their cultural contribution⁵
- No specific legal protection exists in Canada for Indigenous cultural intellectual property⁶

These challenges represent ongoing violations of cultural rights recognized in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, particularly Articles 11 (cultural practices), 12 (spiritual traditions), 13 (cultural transmission) and 31 (cultural heritage)⁷.

## 2. Historical and Colonial Context

### 2.1 Cultural Assimilation Policies

The systematic destruction of Indigenous cultural identity was official Canadian government policy for over a century. Key mechanisms included:

**The Indian Act (1876)**:
- Legal definition of who is "Indian" based on racial and patrilineal criteria⁸
- Prohibition of cultural ceremonies (potlatch, sun dance) from 1884 to 1951⁹
- Pass system limiting movements and cultural gatherings¹⁰
- Forced enfranchisement for those pursuing higher education or professions¹¹

**Residential Schools (1831-1996)**:
- Prohibition of speaking Indigenous languages under threat of corporal punishment¹²
- Forced hair cutting, destruction of traditional clothing¹³
- Ban on all cultural or spiritual practices¹⁴
- Separation of siblings to break family bonds¹⁵

### 2.2 Impact on Cultural Transmission

Colonial policies created profound intergenerational ruptures:

- Loss of 70% of Indigenous languages spoken fluently¹⁶
- Interruption of traditional knowledge transmission¹⁷
- Fragmentation of family and community structures¹⁸
- Internalization of cultural shame ("the Indian in the child")¹⁹

### 2.3 Cultural Resistance and Resilience

Despite repression, Indigenous peoples maintained their cultural identity:

- Clandestine practice of prohibited ceremonies²⁰
- Secret oral transmission of stories and knowledge²¹
- Preservation of sacred objects hidden from authorities²²
- Cultural revitalization movements beginning in the 1960s²³

## 3. Legislative Framework and Current Policies

### 3.1 The Indian Act and Its Amendments

**Bill C-31 (1985)**:
Passed in April 1985 to bring the Indian Act into compliance with gender equality guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Main objectives were:
- Eliminate gender-based discrimination
- Restore status to those who had lost it
- Allow bands to control their membership

**Persistent Limitations**:
While Bill C-31 allowed many women to regain their status, it did not eliminate gender-based discrimination from the Indian Act. Problems include:
- Creation of two status categories (6(1) and 6(2)) creating a hierarchy²⁴
- The "second generation cut-off" rule means that after two generations of marriages with non-status partners, children would no longer be eligible for status
- No additional federal resource allocation to support reinstated persons

**Bills C-3 (2011) and S-3 (2019)**:
In response to the McIvor case, the federal government passed Bill C-3 in 2011. The amendment grants 6(2) status to grandchildren of women who regained their status in 1985. On August 15, 2019, Bill S-3 came into full force. The goal of Bill S-3 was to eliminate remaining sex-based inequities.

### 3.2 Federal Cultural Policies

**Canadian Heritage**:
- 2024-2025 Budget: Limited funding for Indigenous cultural programs²⁵
- Absence of coherent national strategy for cultural protection²⁶
- Fragmentation of responsibilities between ministries²⁷

**Canada Council for the Arts**:
The Creating, Knowing and Sharing program supports individuals, groups, Indigenous-led arts organizations and Indigenous arts/cultural sector development organizations that foster a vital and resilient Indigenous arts ecosystem. However:
- Chronic underfunding relative to needs²⁸
- Eligibility criteria sometimes incompatible with Indigenous practices²⁹

### 3.3 International Legal Framework

**United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007)**:
- Article 11: Right to practice and revitalize cultural traditions³⁰
- Article 12: Right to manifest, practice and teach spiritual traditions³¹
- Article 31: Right to maintain, control and develop cultural heritage³²

**Implementation in Canada**:
- United Nations Declaration Act (2021): Commitment to harmonize laws³³
- Action Plan 2023-2028: Vague measures without clear timelines³⁴
- Absence of binding mechanisms³⁵

## 4. Status and Membership: Systemic Discrimination

### 4.1 The Sexist Legacy of the Indian Act

From 1869 to 1985 (116 years), if an Indian woman married a non-Indian man, she and the children of the marriage were denied Indian status. This discrimination had devastating impacts:

**Emblematic Cases**:
- Yvonne Bédard lost her status when she married a non-Indian in 1964. She separated from her husband and attempted to return to her reserve to live in a house inherited from her mother. She discovered that she and her children no longer had the right to live on the reserve
- Sandra Lovelace took her case to the UN Human Rights Committee which, in 1981, found Canada in violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

### 4.2 Status Categories and Their Consequences

The introduction of registration categories under sections 6(1) and 6(2) and the creation of the "second generation cut-off" inadvertently created the perception among many First Nations that some categories were "better" or "worse" than others.

**Impact on Communities**:
- Division of families according to status categories³⁶
- For First Nations that control their own membership under section 10, their membership code defines who is entitled to membership. Some membership codes differentiate eligibility based on registration category
- Resentment toward reinstated women and their children³⁷

### 4.3 Contemporary Challenges

**Persistent Problems**:
- Second generation cut-off provisions create greater burdens and/or risks for women than for men
- Lines drawn within families and disconnection of community and family ties if individuals are not registered in the "right" category
- Complex bureaucratic processes to prove ancestry³⁸

**Statistical Data (2024)**:
- More than 100,000 people have regained their status since 1985³⁹
- Estimate of 200,000+ people still excluded⁴⁰
- 70% of status applications come from women and their descendants⁴¹

## 5. Cultural Heritage and Repatriation

### 5.1 The Extent of Cultural Dispossession

Museum collections, which include thousands of everyday objects, ceremonial and sacred objects, ancestral skeletal remains and burial objects, were intended to allow future generations of anthropologists and students to study traditional Indigenous cultures.

**Historical Context**:
Most Indigenous ethnological collections found in Canadian museums today were gathered (and sometimes confiscated) by missionaries, government agents, amateur and professional collectors and anthropologists such as Edward Sapir and Marius Barbeau in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

### 5.2 Current State of Repatriation

**Absence of Legislative Framework**:
While no Canadian legislation exists to implement repatriation, museums currently examine requests on a case-by-case basis. This approach creates:
- Inconsistency in decisions⁴²
- Long and costly processes for communities⁴³
- Excessive discretionary power of institutions⁴⁴

**Recent Initiatives**:
In 2019, Liberal MP Bill Casey introduced a private member's bill to develop a national strategy for the repatriation of Indigenous artifacts and remains. The bill died on the Order Paper when elections were called.

### 5.3 Challenges and Obstacles

Royal BC Museum policies prevent the repatriation of treasures and ancestors to an individual's care. They must instead be returned to an entity, such as a band council or cultural center.

**Systemic Barriers**:
- Repatriation is also costly, and the onus rests primarily on communities to find necessary funding
- Some museums remain "steeped in the colonial mentality" that Indigenous peoples don't know how to care for their own possessions
- Documents reporting the acquisition of objects may be rare or totally absent. This can make it difficult to determine the group of origin

### 5.4 Emblematic Cases

**Recent Successes**:
- The Aanischaaukamikw Cree Cultural Institute discovered a 171-year-old Cree beaded hood in a Montreal museum
- Repatriation of the Nisga'a Ni'isjoohl totem from Scotland (2023)⁴⁵
- The remains of Demasduwit and Nonosbawsut were repatriated from Scotland in 2019

**Hudson's Bay Company Controversy (2025)**:
The April 2025 announcement that the 355-year-old company would auction its collection of 4,400 objects of national importance placed the former retail giant in the middle of ongoing discourse on repatriation. Concerns include:
- No assurance that objects are not stolen⁴⁶
- Contradiction with Canada's commitment to reconciliation and a 2019 UN Human Rights Council resolution

## 6. Media and Representation

### 6.1 Persistent Stereotypes

Carmen Robertson, co-author of Seeing Red: A History of Natives in Canadian Newspapers, reveals how the press consistently uses recurring stereotypes and misrepresents Indigenous peoples.

**Documented Stereotypes**:
In 1996, when the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples examined representations of Indigenous peoples in media, it concluded that many Canadians know Indigenous peoples only as the Pathetic Victim, Noble Environmentalist or Angry Warrior

Media have always shaped public perception of Indigenous peoples: the wise elder (Little Big Man); the princess (Pocahontas); the loyal sidekick (Tonto) - these images have become engraved in the consciousness of North Americans.

### 6.2 Quantitative Underrepresentation

**Alarming Data**:
A study on children's animation in Canada found only four Indigenous characters out of 121
- Near-total absence in leading roles⁴⁷
- Overrepresentation in victim or antagonist roles⁴⁸

### 6.3 New York Times Impact (2019)

When the New York Times published a recent article on Inuit artists from Cape Dorset, there was an outcry regarding harmful stereotypes used in the reporting. The article titled "Drawn From Poverty: Art Was Supposed to Save Canada's Inuit. It Hasn't" illustrates:
- Persistence of colonial prejudices in international media⁴⁹
- The Native American Journalists Association (NAJA) called on the Times to do better and highlighted the need for an audit of how the article was published

### 6.4 Biased Media Coverage

Research analyzed stories "to understand how Indigenous peoples are portrayed, what themes might be problematic or beneficial, and how news agencies can improve their reporting on Indigenous issues."

**Study Results (2022)**:
- Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) had the highest percentage of balanced articles and the lowest percentage of unbalanced articles
- In terms of position, the Edmonton Sun, Calgary Herald, National Post and CBC websites had the highest percentage of anti-Indigenous positions

## 7. Sports and Recreation

### 7.1 Systemic Discrimination in Sports

Racism and discrimination in sports have recently attracted significant public attention, leading to efforts among sports organizations to implement policies and programs aimed at promoting a culture of safety to prevent harm.

**Recent Data (2023)**:
Willson et al.'s study on mistreatment among Canadian Olympians and Paralympians found that racialized athletes were more likely to experience physical harm and Indigenous athletes were more likely to experience psychological harm

### 7.2 Chronic Underfunding

The Government of Canada fully recognizes that expression through sport remains a key element of Indigenous identity. Since its inception in 1990, Sport Canada has been a regular funder of the North American Indigenous Games (NAIG).

**Current Investments**:
- Budget 2022 announced $20 million in renewed funding over 5 years for Indigenous youth and sport
- The $24.2 million investment will support 119 Indigenous-led projects, expanding access to sport and physical activity

### 7.3 TRC Calls to Action Not Respected

In the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada's final report (2015), of the 94 calls to action, five concerned sport. Call #90 asked all levels of government to work collaboratively to ensure that national sports policies, programs and initiatives include Indigenous peoples.

**Implementation Status**:
Unfortunately, very little has been done to combat anti-Indigenous racism and discrimination in sport in Canada, and there has been no investigation into how safe sport could be used as a means to combat it

### 7.4 Positive Initiatives

**Sport for Social Development Program**:
Stream Three: $2.5 million is available annually for Indigenous governments, communities and other Indigenous non-profit organizations that specifically support sports and recreation projects serving Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQI+ people

**Tom Longboat Awards**:
The Tom Longboat Awards were created in 1951 to recognize Indigenous athletes for their outstanding contributions to sport in Canada

## 8. Arts and Creative Industries

### 8.1 Indigenous Arts Funding

The Canada Council for the Arts is committed to reaffirming and revitalizing its relationship with the First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada.

**Creating, Knowing and Sharing Program**:
This program operates with a self-determined and Indigenous-centered approach. This means it will be guided by Indigenous values and worldviews, administered by staff of First Nations, Inuit and Métis heritage, and assessed by First Nations, Inuit and Métis people

**Persistent Challenges**:
- Underrepresentation on funding juries⁵⁰
- Evaluation criteria unsuited to Indigenous artistic practices⁵¹
- Lack of stable multi-year funding⁵²

### 8.2 Underestimated Economic Contribution

**Economic Impact**:
- Indigenous arts generate millions in tourism revenue⁵³
- Direct and indirect job creation in communities⁵⁴
- Cultural exports enhancing Canada's image⁵⁵

### 8.3 Systemic Barriers

**Documented Obstacles**:
- Limited access to cultural infrastructure in communities⁵⁶
- Lack of appropriate professional training⁵⁷
- Absence of equitable distribution networks⁵⁸

## 9. Indigenous Intellectual Property

### 9.1 Absence of Legal Protection

The intersection of the intellectual property (IP) system and the protection of Indigenous knowledge and cultural expressions is receiving increasing attention from Indigenous peoples in Canada, government policy makers and in international trade and policy forums.

**Current Gaps**:
- No specific law protecting traditional knowledge⁵⁹
- Indigenous heritage includes all objects, sites and knowledge transmitted from generation to generation. The heritage of Indigenous peoples is a living heritage
- Cultural appropriation not legally sanctioned⁶⁰

### 9.2 Government Initiatives

In spring 2018, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development announced the Intellectual Property Strategy as part of Canada's Innovation and Skills Plan.

**Indigenous Intellectual Property Program**:
The Indigenous Intellectual Property Program (IIPP) grant program supports awareness and capacity building for Indigenous peoples on IP as well as participation in the development and implementation of IP laws, policies and programs

### 9.3 International Issues

Canada participates in international negotiations at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore.

**Persistent Challenges**:
- Western definitions incompatible with Indigenous conceptions⁶¹
- Collective protection vs individual rights⁶²
- Limited duration vs perpetual heritage⁶³

## 10. Recommendations and Way Forward

### 10.1 Urgent Legislative Reforms

1. **Repeal and replace the Indian Act** with legislation respecting self-determination and eliminating all discrimination based on gender or generation

2. **National Repatriation Law** establishing:
   - Legal obligation to return sacred objects and ancestral remains
   - Dedicated funding for repatriation processes
   - Binding timelines for institutions

3. **Indigenous Cultural Intellectual Property Law** protecting:
   - Traditional knowledge and cultural expressions
   - Collective and perpetual rights
   - Remedies against cultural appropriation

### 10.2 Necessary Investments

1. **Equitable Arts Funding**: Parity with population percentage (5%) for all cultural programs

2. **Cultural Infrastructure**: $500 million over 5 years for cultural centers in communities

3. **Repatriation Program**: $100 million to support the return of cultural objects

4. **Media Training**: National program for Indigenous journalists

### 10.3 Systemic Changes

1. **Mandatory Representation** on all cultural boards of directors (minimum 20%)

2. **Indigenous Content Quotas** in public media (minimum 10%)

3. **Mandatory Training** on Indigenous history and culture for all cultural sector professionals

4. **Independent Complaint Mechanisms** for cultural discrimination

### 10.4 Vision for Cultural Reconciliation

Cultural revitalization is at the heart of healing colonial trauma. As Louis Riel predicted: "My people will sleep for one hundred years. When they awaken, it will be the artists who give them back their spirit." This awakening is underway but requires systemic support to fully flourish.
