## 1. Executive Summary

Indigenous peoples in Canada face a persistent crisis regarding their territorial and environmental rights, despite significant legal advances. First Nations are currently seeking open, transparent and effective mechanisms to address their fundamental needs regarding lands and nation-to-nation relationships (Assembly of First Nations, 2024¹).

Data reveal critical issues:
- **Land claims**: Without access to an effective remedial mechanism, these First Nations are forced to engage in costly and prolonged litigation or rely on the political goodwill of the Government of Canada (AFN, 2024¹)
- **UNDRIP implementation**: The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act became law on June 21, 2021 (Department of Justice Canada, 2023²)
- **Indigenous protected areas**: IPCAs recognize the intimate relationship between Indigenous peoples and the lands and waters in their territories (CPAWS BC, 2023³)
- **Climate change**: The Arctic and Subarctic are two of the first regions in the world to experience the direct and local impacts of a warming planet (Indigenous Peoples Atlas of Canada, 2024⁴)

## 2. Historical and Legal Context

### 2.1 Evolution of Indigenous Land Rights

Canada's legal system concerning Indigenous land rights was built on colonial foundations that continue to influence relationships today. Indigenous peoples have lived on the lands we now call Canada for thousands of years, with their own unique cultures, identities, traditions, languages and institutions (Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, 2024⁵).

**Historic treaties (1701-1923)**:
Beginning in 1701, the British Crown entered into treaties with Indigenous groups in the British colonies of North America, which would later become parts of Canada. Treaties supported peaceful economic and military relations (CIRNAC, 2024⁵). Historic treaties signed after 1763 provided for large areas of land, occupied by First Nations, to the Crown, transferring their Aboriginal title to the Crown in exchange for reserve lands and other benefits (CIRNAC, 2024⁵).

**The Royal Proclamation of 1763**:
The treaty-making process was formally established by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 (CIRNAC, 2024⁵). This proclamation recognized Indigenous land rights and established a process for their cession.

### 2.2 Colonial Legacy and Its Impacts

Over many centuries, these relationships were eroded by colonial and paternalistic policies that were enacted into law. Canada has embarked on a journey of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. It is a necessary journey to address a long history of colonialism and the scars it has left (CIRNAC, 2024⁵).

Documented impacts include:
- Massive territorial dispossession
- Destruction of traditional governance systems
- Prohibition of spiritual practices linked to the land
- Fragmentation of traditional territories by provincial and international borders

## 3. Current Constitutional and Legislative Framework

### 3.1 Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982

Treaty rights and Aboriginal rights, commonly referred to as Indigenous rights, are recognized and affirmed in section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 (CIRNAC, 2024⁵). This constitutional recognition represents a major turning point in the legal protection of Indigenous land rights.

### 3.2 Government of Canada Guiding Principles

The Government of Canada has established principles to guide its relationship with Indigenous peoples:

**Recognition of inherent rights**:
The Government of Canada's recognition of the ongoing presence and inherent rights of Indigenous peoples as a defining feature of Canada is grounded in the promise of section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 (Department of Justice Canada, 2024⁶).

**Self-determination and governance**:
This principle affirms the inherent right of self-government as an existing Aboriginal right within section 35. Recognition of the inherent jurisdiction and legal orders of Indigenous nations is therefore the starting point of discussions aimed at interactions among federal, provincial, territorial, and Indigenous jurisdictions and laws (Department of Justice, 2024⁶).

**Aboriginal title**:
The Supreme Court of Canada has confirmed that Aboriginal title confers on the holder the right to use, control and manage the land and the right to the economic benefits of the land and its resources (Department of Justice, 2024⁶).

### 3.3 Free, Prior and Informed Consent

This principle recognizes the Government of Canada's commitment to new nation-to-nation, government-to-government, and Inuit-Crown relationships that builds on and goes beyond the legal duty to consult (Department of Justice, 2024⁶).

The Supreme Court of Canada has clarified that the standard for achieving consent of Indigenous peoples is strongest in the case of Aboriginal title lands (Department of Justice, 2024⁶).

## 4. UNDRIP Implementation

### 4.1 Adoption and Action Plan

The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act became law on June 21, 2021 (Department of Justice Canada, 2023²). Implementing the United Nations Declaration is essential to creating a just, inclusive, and equitable society (Department of Justice, 2023²).

**Key UNDRIP articles for lands and territories**:
- Article 26: Indigenous peoples have the right to the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired (Georgia Strait Alliance, 2022⁷)
- Article 32: UNDRIP states that Indigenous peoples have the right to determine and develop priorities and strategies for the development or use of their lands or territories and other resources (Centre for International Governance Innovation, 2024⁸)

### 4.2 Implementation Challenges

Despite its name, the Action Plan contains few specific, measurable commitments. Much of the text commits the government to do things it is already doing (JFK Law, 2024⁹).

**Main criticisms**:
- The Action Plan measures fail to consistently identify a pathway—or even a specific objective—to support achieving each commitment (MLT Aikins, 2023¹⁰)
- Although the Action Plan is valid from 2023 to 2028, almost all measures fail to identify a timeline within which they will be implemented (MLT Aikins, 2023¹⁰)

### 4.3 Integration into Environmental Policies

In Canada, UNDRIP is gaining traction in guiding environmental policy. Bill C-69 was passed in 2019 and resulted in changes to the federal environmental impact assessment process (Indigenous Climate Hub, 2021¹¹).

The Impact Assessment Act clearly states that the Government of Canada is committed to implementing the Declaration and ensuring that the rights of Indigenous peoples are respected throughout federal impact assessments (Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, 2024¹²).

## 5. Indigenous Environmental Governance Systems

### 5.1 Indigenous Knowledge Systems

Indigenous knowledge is not just "knowledge" (a noun) but a way of life, something that must be lived (a verb) to be understood. Indigenous knowledge is inseparable from the people who hold and live this knowledge (McGregor, 2021¹³).

**Distinctive characteristics**:
- Indigenous knowledge includes not only direct observation and interaction with plants, animals, and ecosystems, but also a broad range of cultural and spiritual knowledge and values that underpin human-environment relationships (Jessen et al., 2022¹⁴)
- Traditional ecological knowledge is a cumulative body of knowledge, practice, and belief about the relationships of living beings with one another and with their environment (Indigenous Climate Hub, 2024¹⁵)

### 5.2 Holistic Approach to Governance

Indigenous peoples speak of inherent rights accompanied by inherent responsibilities to the natural world (David Suzuki Foundation, 2021¹⁶). This approach contrasts with the Western view of nature as property or resource.

**Governance principles**:
- Reciprocity with nature
- Intergenerational responsibility
- Integration of spiritual dimensions
- Collective decision-making

### 5.3 Integration into Canadian Policies

The Canadian Environmental Protection Act (1999) recognizes "the integral role of science, as well as the role of traditional aboriginal ecological knowledge, in the process of making decisions related to the protection of the environment and human health" (Alexander et al., 2019¹⁷).

## 6. Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas (IPCAs)

### 6.1 Definition and Principles

IPCAs are lands and waters where Indigenous governments have the primary role in protecting and conserving ecosystems through Indigenous laws, governance and knowledge systems. Culture and language are the heart and soul of an IPCA (CPAWS BC, 2023³).

**Three essential elements**:
1. They are Indigenous-led
2. They represent a long-term commitment to conservation
3. They elevate Indigenous rights and responsibilities (Indigenous Leadership Initiative, 2024¹⁸)

### 6.2 Success Stories

**Thaidene Nëné (N.W.T.)**:
In 2019, the Łutsël K'e Dene First Nation signed an agreement with Parks Canada and the Government of the Northwest Territories to protect 26,376 square kilometres. Called Thaidene Nëné, the Land of the Ancestors, it will be co-managed by the Łutsël K'e Dene First Nation (Indigenous Leadership Initiative, 2024¹⁸).

**Edéhzhíe (N.W.T.)**:
In 2018, the Dehcho First Nations passed Dene law to protect 14,249 square kilometres of boreal forest (Indigenous Leadership Initiative, 2024¹⁸).

### 6.3 Impact on Biodiversity

Indigenous peoples are the most effective land stewards. Indigenous-managed lands and waters cover about 20% of the planet, yet support 80% of global biodiversity (CPAWS BC, 2023³).

### 6.4 Government Funding and Support

Indigenous-Led Area-Based Conservation (ILABC) provides funding to Indigenous peoples to lead or co-lead the establishment and recognition of protected areas or other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) across Canada (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2024¹⁹).

Over $1.2 billion has been committed to Indigenous-led conservation since 2018, through a number of federal initiatives (The Narwhal, 2024²⁰).

### 6.5 Indigenous Guardian Programs

There are more than 1,000 Indigenous guardians across Canada, and more than 170 guardian programs (The Narwhal, 2024²⁰).

A 2016 case study on guardian programs in the Northwest Territories found that for every dollar invested, they generated $2.50 in economic, cultural and environmental benefits—and that with broader national support, this could increase to $3.70 (The Narwhal, 2024²⁰).

## 7. Climate Change and Environmental Justice

### 7.1 Disproportionate Impacts on Indigenous Peoples

The Arctic and the Subarctic are two of the first regions in the world to experience the direct and local impacts of a warming planet, and we Inuit recognize that our homelands play a central role in regulating the Earth's climate system (Indigenous Peoples Atlas of Canada, 2024⁴).

**Documented impacts**:
- Unprecedented rates of summer sea ice loss, reduced winter sea ice, ocean acidification, increased temperature and sea level, melting permafrost, extreme weather events and severe coastal erosion are undermining our ability to thrive in our environment (Indigenous Peoples Atlas, 2024⁴)
- There is an increase in on-ice hazards and risks, including an increase in incidents of Inuit falling through the ice (Indigenous Peoples Atlas, 2024⁴)

### 7.2 Food Security and Traditional Ways of Life

Rapid climate change is affecting our ability to access our traditional foods (wild foods harvested from our lands and waters) at a time when too many families are already struggling to put food on the table (Indigenous Peoples Atlas, 2024⁴).

In the Arctic region, Indigenous peoples depend on hunting polar bears (United Nations, 2024²¹), an activity now threatened by melting ice.

### 7.3 Climate Justice and Human Rights

Climate injustice is pronounced for many Arctic Indigenous peoples, created by the interaction of climate impacts with inequalities, land dispossession and sedentarization stemming from colonial histories, which create vulnerability and undermine resilience (Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, 2021²²).

**Documented rights violations**:
- Many of these impacts threaten or violate Indigenous peoples' rights to their traditional or inhabited lands, territories and resources, their right to maintain cultural and spiritual relationships with the land, and their right to preserve and access cultural sites (Georgetown Journal, 2021²²)

### 7.4 Adaptation Based on Traditional Knowledge

Indigenous peoples, while representing only a small fraction of the global population, manage between 13 and 20% of the world's land, which contains about 80% of the world's remaining biodiversity (The Arctic Institute, 2024²³).

In many Indigenous communities, water is considered a sacred resource that must be protected and used wisely. Traditional water management techniques, such as building small dams and using natural filtration systems, are being revived and adapted to address changing precipitation patterns and increased flood risks (Indigenous Climate Hub, 2024¹⁵).

### 7.5 Nature-Based Solutions

Integrating Indigenous knowledge with nature-based solutions offers a profound depth of understanding that is often missed in conventional approaches. Indigenous communities possess detailed, context-specific knowledge about their environments, enabling the design of more nuanced and effective solutions (The Arctic Institute, 2024²³).

## 8. Current Challenges and Opportunities

### 8.1 Unresolved Land Claims

The comprehensive land claims policy is inconsistent with Canadian and international law and is based on the denial of First Nations' land rights (Assembly of First Nations, 2024¹).

**Systemic obstacles**:
- First Nations cannot use Aboriginal title or punitive damages as a basis for their claims (Wikipedia, 2025²⁴)
- The Government of Canada typically resolves specific claims by negotiating monetary compensation for the breach with the band government, and in exchange, they require the extinguishment of the First Nation's rights to the lands in question (Wikipedia, 2025²⁴)

### 8.2 Aboriginal Title Recognition

Canadian courts have recognized the existence of Aboriginal title since the 1973 Calder v. British Columbia case, yet only one Indigenous nation, the Tsilhqot'in, has successfully obtained a declaration of Aboriginal title (Environmental Defence, 2021²⁵).

For Indigenous nations to exercise these rights, they must go to court to "prove" the existence of specific rights, articulate their nature and determine their scope. This presents an access to justice problem (Environmental Defence, 2021²⁵).

### 8.3 Criminalization of Land Defenders

Amnesty International's annual global letter-writing campaign will see hundreds of thousands of people around the world calling on Canadian lawmakers to stop the criminalization of Indigenous land defenders with the Wet'suwet'en Nation and their allies (Amnesty International Canada, 2024²⁶).

In 2022, the BC Prosecution Service decided to charge 20 land defenders with criminal contempt for allegedly disobeying an injunction order to stay away from pipeline construction sites (Amnesty Canada, 2024²⁶).

### 8.4 Land Back Movement

Land Back is an Indigenous-led movement that means different things to different people (David Suzuki Foundation, 2021¹⁶). Land Back is really about decision-making power. It's about self-determination for our peoples here, which should include some access to territories and resources in a more equitable way, and for us to have control over how that actually looks (David Suzuki Foundation, 2021¹⁶).

### 8.5 Economic Reconciliation Opportunities

Budget 2024 also proposes investments in Indigenous self-determination and economic reconciliation. It is only fair that Indigenous communities build prosperity—on their own terms (Government of Canada, 2024²⁷).

## 9. Recommendations and Way Forward

### 9.1 Urgent Legislative Reforms

1. **Aboriginal title recognition**: For Canada to fully implement UNDRIP, it should make meaningful recognition of Aboriginal title (Environmental Defence, 2021²⁵)

2. **Claims policy reform**: First Nations have made it clear through AFN Resolution 25/2019 that the comprehensive land claims policy must be repealed and replaced with alternative approaches consistent with the United Nations Declaration (AFN, 2024¹)

3. **Independent mechanisms**: This resolution calls on the Government of Canada to work in coordination with the AFN and the Chiefs Committee on Lands, Territories and Resources to develop a fully independent specific claims process (AFN, 2024¹)

### 9.2 Support for IPCAs

1. **Stable funding**: Increase and sustain funding for IPCAs beyond current commitments

2. **Legal recognition**: No pathway currently exists to recognize or support IPCAs through provincial or federal legislation or policy (West Coast Environmental Law, 2024²⁸)

3. **Guardian programs**: Expand funding to reach all interested communities

### 9.3 Integration of Indigenous Knowledge

1. **Epistemic parity**: Recognize Indigenous knowledge systems as equal to Western sciences in environmental decision-making

2. **Ethical protocols**: Appropriate and effective support of Indigenous knowledge requires recognition of the systems that support it, which in turn requires support for Indigenous self-determination (McGregor, 2021¹³)

3. **Mandatory training**: Integrate Indigenous perspectives into all environmental management training programs

### 9.4 Climate Justice

1. **Indigenous-led adaptation**: Directly fund climate adaptation initiatives designed and implemented by Indigenous communities

2. **Protection of cultural sites**: Develop urgent strategies to protect sites threatened by climate change

3. **Food security**: Support traditional food systems and their adaptation to new conditions

### 9.5 Systemic Transformation

Globally, Indigenous peoples represent less than five percent of the world's population, yet protect 80 percent of the planet's biodiversity (David Suzuki Foundation, 2021¹⁶). This reality demonstrates the urgency of transforming environmental governance systems to center Indigenous leadership.

The way forward requires:
- Respect for Indigenous sovereignty over traditional territories
- Investment in Indigenous governance capacity
- Recognition that Indigenous solutions are essential for planetary survival
- Commitment to genuine reconciliation through action, not just words
