## 1. Executive Summary

Indigenous peoples in Canada face deep and persistent health disparities that represent a humanitarian and human rights crisis. Data from 2024-2025 reveals that despite substantial investments, gaps continue to widen in several critical areas:

- **Life expectancy gap**: Up to 15.8 years less for Inuit men, with an average life expectancy of 64.0 years compared to 79.8 years for non-Indigenous men (Statistics Canada, 2019¹)
- **Access to care**: 24% of Indigenous people report experiencing discrimination in the healthcare system in 2024 (Statistics Canada, 2024²)
- **Infrastructure**: 31 long-term boil water advisories in 29 First Nations communities as of November 2024 (Indigenous Services Canada, 2024³)
- **Mental health**: Suicide rates among Inuit youth reaching up to 40 times the national rate in some communities (Statistics Canada, 2021⁴)
- **Access to doctors**: 56.5% of Inuit and 20.3% of First Nations off-reserve do not have a regular family doctor, compared to 14.5% for the non-Indigenous population (Statistics Canada, 2023⁵)

The tragic death of Joyce Echaquan in September 2020 catalyzed a national movement to confront systemic racism in healthcare. The Quebec coroner concluded that "racism and prejudice contributed to the death" and that Ms. Echaquan would still be alive if she had been white (Bureau du Coroner du Québec, 2021⁶). Joyce's Principle, developed by the Atikamekw Nation, calls for recognition and guarantee of the right of all Indigenous peoples to equitable access to social and health services, without discrimination (Conseil de la Nation Atikamekw, 2020⁷).

Recent data shows that 86% of First Nations off-reserve, 82% of Inuit, and 70% of Métis consider access to traditional Indigenous medicines as very or somewhat important in the Canadian healthcare system (Statistics Canada, 2024²). However, the majority do not have access, revealing a major gap between needs and available services.

This report documents not only persistent challenges but also solutions led by Indigenous communities themselves, including Indigenous-led health governance models showing promising results.

## 2. Historical and Colonial Context

### 2.1 Colonial Roots of Health Inequalities

The Canadian healthcare system was built on colonial foundations that continue to influence care today. As Kim (2019) and Czyzewski (2011) note, colonialism acts as a broader social determinant of health, creating structural conditions that perpetuate inequalities⁸⁹. The Indian Act of 1876 created a system of legal segregation that persists in the current fragmentation of health services for Indigenous peoples (Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, 1996¹⁰).

**The Legacy of Residential Schools (1831-1996)**:
- Over 150,000 children forced into 139 residential schools (Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 2015¹¹)
- Mortality rates reaching 60% in some institutions (TRC, 2015¹¹)
- Intergenerational trauma affecting physical and mental health of survivors and their descendants. Bombay et al. (2014) demonstrate that impacts are transmitted over 3-4 generations, with 65% of survivors reporting ongoing impacts on their mental health¹²
- Systematic destruction of traditional healing practices (TRC, 2015¹¹)

Recent research confirms that the colonial legacy continues to directly affect health. Elias et al. (2012) established an empirical link between residential school experience and suicidal behaviors in Indigenous populations¹³. Barnes et al. (2006) documented lasting cognitive and academic impacts¹⁴.

**The Sixties Scoop (1960-1980)**:
- More than 20,000 Indigenous children removed from their families (Sinclair, 2007¹⁵)
- Placement in non-Indigenous families, often abroad, creating profound cultural rupture (Sinclair, 2007¹⁵)
- Loss of cultural identity contributing to current mental health problems (Bombay et al., 2014¹²)

### 2.2 Evolution of the Indigenous Health System

**Pre-Confederation Period**:
Indigenous peoples possessed sophisticated health systems based on a holistic vision integrating physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual dimensions. The World Health Organization now recognizes this approach as essential for Indigenous peoples' health globally (WHO, 2023¹⁶). Traditional medicines, developed over millennia, were effective and adapted to local environments (Martin-Hill, 2003¹⁷).

**Post-Confederation (1867-present)**:
Confederation created a parallel and unequal system. Federal responsibility for "Indians and lands reserved" (Constitution Act, 1867, s.91(24)¹⁸) established a complex jurisdictional mosaic that persists today. Lux (2016) documents how this system was designed to be inferior from the start¹⁹.

The introduction of the Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) Program in 1979 aimed to fill certain gaps but created new bureaucratic barriers. In 2024, the program serves more than 950,000 beneficiaries with a budget of $2.1 billion (Indigenous Services Canada, 2024²⁰).

### 2.3 Impact of Colonization on Social Determinants of Health

Recent research, including the Public Health Agency of Canada (2018) report, confirms that social determinants of health are deeply affected by colonial history²¹. Reading and Wien (2009) identify three levels of determinants:

1. **Distal determinants**: Socioeconomic status, education, employment
2. **Intermediate determinants**: Community infrastructure, health systems, social capital
3. **Proximal determinants**: Health behaviors, physical environment²²

The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996) documented how colonial policies systematically dismantled these structures¹⁰:

- **Territorial dispossession**: Loss of 98% of traditional lands affecting food security. In 2020, 48% of Inuit households live in food insecurity (Statistics Canada, 2020²³)
- **Economic destruction**: Bans on potlatch and other traditional economic practices (Indian Act amendments, 1884-1951) destroyed Indigenous economic systems²⁴
- **Family fragmentation**: Policies aimed at "killing the Indian in the child" have repercussions to this day²⁵
- **Political marginalization**: Exclusion from decision-making processes continues to affect self-determination in health (RCAP, 1996¹⁰)

## 3. Legislative Framework and Current Policies

### 3.1 Division of Responsibilities

The Canadian healthcare system for Indigenous peoples is characterized by unique jurisdictional complexity that creates gaps and delays in services (Indigenous Services Canada, 2024²⁶):

**Federal Level**:
- Indigenous Services Canada (ISC): Health services for First Nations on reserve and Inuit, with a budget of $5.7 billion in 2023-2024 (ISC, 2024²⁶)
- NIHB Program: Covers medications, dental care, vision care, medical transportation for 950,000+ beneficiaries (ISC, 2024²⁰)
- Jordan's Principle: $8.8 billion invested since 2016, with 8.9 million products, services, and supports approved (ISC, 2025²⁷)

**Provincial/Territorial Level**:
Provinces offer general health services but with significant variations in recognizing Indigenous needs. Lavoie (2013) documents how this fragmentation creates "grey areas" where no one assumes responsibility²⁸.

**Indigenous Governments**:
Innovative models are emerging:
- First Nations Health Authority of B.C. (established 2013): First provincial health authority led by Indigenous peoples²⁹
- Nunavik Regional Board of Health and Social Services: Regional autonomy model since 1978³⁰
- Over 600 transfer agreements allowing community management (ISC, 2024³¹)

### 3.2 Canada Health Act and Indigenous Peoples

The Canada Health Act establishes five principles, but their application reveals systemic gaps for Indigenous peoples (Lavoie et al., 2016³²):

1. **Public administration**: Jurisdictional fragmentation violates this principle
2. **Comprehensiveness**: "Medically necessary" services often exclude traditional approaches
3. **Universality**: Access remains profoundly unequal, particularly in remote regions
4. **Portability**: Complications for out-of-province services create barriers
5. **Accessibility**: Geographic, linguistic, and cultural barriers persist

Boyer (2017) argues that the current application of these principles constitutes systemic discrimination³³.

### 3.3 Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) Program

**Current Coverage (2024)**:
The program has evolved but maintains structural challenges:
- Annual budget: $2.1 billion (2023-2024), a 40% increase since 2015 (ISC Annual Report, 2024³⁴)
- Average processing time for applications: 25 business days for complex cases (OAG, 2023³⁵)
- Initial rejection rate: 18% of applications, with 60% reversed on appeal (AFN, 2024³⁶)

**Documented Persistent Challenges**:
- Approval processes creating critical delays for urgent treatments
- Restrictive definition of "medically necessary" excluding holistic approaches
- Exclusion of essential mental health services and traditional medicine
- Language barriers: forms available only in English and French

### 3.4 Jordan's Principle - 2024-2025 Update

Jordan's Principle has seen major recent developments:

**Investments and Results**:
- $8.8 billion invested since 2016 (ISC, 2025²⁷)
- 8.9 million products, services, and supports approved (ISC, 2025²⁷)
- 140,000 applications in backlog identified in December 2024 (CBC, 2025³⁷)

**Controversial 2025 Changes**:
In February 2025, the government announced restrictions including³⁸:
- Exclusion of home renovations
- Limitation on international travel
- Restrictions on sporting events
- Requirement for medical letters for non-medical supports

**Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Decision (November 2024)**:
The CHRT clarified the definition of urgency and ordered Canada to address the backlog, reaffirming that Jordan's Principle is not a fixed-budget program but a legal obligation³⁹.

## 4. Statistical Portrait of Health Disparities

### 4.1 Life Expectancy and Mortality - Updated Data

The latest data confirms persistent and in some cases widening gaps:

Horrill et al. (2022) identify multiple barriers⁴⁸:
- **Geographic**: 50% of communities are remote or isolated
- **Cultural**: Services available in Indigenous languages in <5% of facilities
- **Systemic**: Staff turnover reaching 80% annually in some regions
- **Economic**: Average cost of medical travel: $3,000-5,000

### 5.2 Specialized Services - Limited and Costly Access

**Documented Wait Times (2023)**:
The CIHI report shows major disparities⁴⁹:
- Specialist consultation: 6-12 months in remote regions vs 3 months in urban settings
- Mental health services: up to 2 years wait
- Elective surgery: 18 months longer than provincial average

## 9. Priorities Identified by Indigenous Organizations

### 9.1 Assembly of First Nations - 2024-2029 Plan

**Strategic Priorities**:
1. Distinct First Nations health legislation
2. Elimination of discriminatory NIHB program
3. Funding parity with provincial systems
4. Infrastructure: $5 billion over 5 years
5. Training of 10,000 Indigenous professionals

### 9.2 Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami - Inuit Strategy

**Arctic Focus**:
- Permanent infrastructure vs fly-in services
- Return of births to the North
- Integration of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit
- Climate change adaptation
- Food security and health

### 9.3 Métis National Council

**Recognition and Services**:
- Inclusion in all health policies
- National Métis health registry
- Adapted urban services
- Research on distinct needs

## 10. Conclusion and Way Forward

### 10.1 The Urgency to Act

Data from 2024-2025 confirms that disparities persist and in some cases worsen. Canada violates its obligations under:
- The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
- Historical and modern treaties
- The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
- International human rights law

### 10.2 Required Paradigm Shift

The necessary transformation includes:

1. **Recognition**: Of systemic racism as proven reality
2. **Reparation**: Compensation for historical and ongoing damages
3. **Restitution**: Transfer of control to Indigenous peoples
4. **Resources**: Constitutionally guaranteed equitable funding
5. **Respect**: For holistic and traditional approaches

### 10.3 Required Immediate Measures

1. Legislative adoption of Joyce's Principle
2. Emergency funding of $10 billion over 2 years
3. Health authority transfer by 2030
4. Mandatory anti-racism training for all professionals
5. Independent monitoring and complaints mechanism

### 10.4 Vision of Hope

Despite immense challenges, success models demonstrate that transformation is possible. Self-determination in health is not just a right, but the most effective path to equity. Indigenous peoples have the solutions - they need the power and resources to implement them.

As the coroner stated in the Echaquan case: "It is my duty to do everything in my power to prevent another member of Indigenous communities from receiving care like that offered to Ms. Echaquan."

The time for reports is over. The time for action is now.
