## 1. Executive Summary

Indigenous peoples of Canada face systemic educational gaps that represent a continuing violation of their fundamental rights and perpetuate socioeconomic inequalities. In 2024, data reveals alarming disparities that persist despite significant government investments:

- **Secondary graduation**: Only 63% of First Nations youth (19-30 years) have completed secondary education, compared to 91% of the non-Indigenous population (Statistics Canada, 2023¹)
- **Post-secondary education**: 16% of Indigenous people hold a university degree versus 36% of the general population (Colleges and Institutes Canada, 2024²)
- **Growing gap**: Despite an increase in the number of Indigenous people with bachelor's degrees since 2016, the gap with the non-Indigenous population has widened (Statistics Canada, 2023²)
- **Overrepresentation in special education**: Identification and placement rates in special education are 2-3 times higher in First Nations schools (Assembly of First Nations, 2024³)

The legacy of residential schools continues to traumatize current generations. Over 150,000 children were forced to attend 139 residential schools between 1831 and 1996, where they suffered systematic physical, sexual, and cultural abuse (Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 2015⁴). Intergenerational impacts include language loss, family fragmentation, and high rates of mental health issues (Wilk et al., 2017⁵).

This report examines the structural causes of these disparities, including chronic underfunding (2% annual growth cap since 1996), lack of culturally adapted programs, and absence of Indigenous control over education. It also presents promising models and priorities identified by Indigenous organizations for systemic transformation.

## 2. Historical and Colonial Context

### 2.1 The Legacy of Residential Schools (1831-1996)

The residential school system represents one of the most devastating cultural assimilation policies in Canadian history. Officially established in 1831 with the opening of the Mohawk Institute in Ontario, these institutions explicitly aimed to "kill the Indian in the child" (Duncan Campbell Scott, 1920⁶).

**Documented scope and impacts**:
- 139 residential schools operated across Canada (NCTR, 2025⁷)
- Over 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend (TRC, 2015⁴)
- At least 3,200 children died in these institutions (TRC, 2015⁴)
- Mortality rates reaching 25% in some establishments (Wilk et al., 2017⁵)

Children were systematically punished for speaking their mother tongue, often through physical and psychological torture (The Indigenous Foundation, 2022⁸). The education provided was of inferior quality, focusing primarily on manual labor and prayer rather than literacy and academic skills (Indigenous Foundations UBC, 2020⁹).

### 2.2 Intergenerational Impacts on Education

Research demonstrates that residential school trauma is transmitted across multiple generations (Bombay et al., 2014¹⁰):

**Trauma transmission**:
- Children of survivors have 2.35 times higher risk of experiencing sexual assault (The Indigenous Foundation, 2022⁸)
- Youth with a parent or grandparent survivor show higher rates of suicidal behaviors (Global Citizen, 2022¹¹)
- 91% of First Nations members reporting inappropriate opioid use attended residential school (PMC, 2023¹²)

**Impacts on parenting capacity**:
- Loss of positive parental models and traditional child-rearing practices (CBC, 2021¹³)
- Normalization of institutional violence affecting parenting styles (PMC, 2014¹⁴)
- Difficulties transmitting language and culture to subsequent generations (NCTR, 2025⁷)

### 2.3 Destruction of Traditional Educational Systems

Before colonization, Indigenous peoples possessed sophisticated educational systems based on:
- Learning through observation and participation (The Canadian Encyclopedia, 2015¹⁵)
- Oral transmission of knowledge by elders
- Holistic education integrating spiritual, physical, mental, and emotional dimensions
- Learning adapted to natural cycles and traditional ways of life

These systems were systematically dismantled by colonial policies, creating an educational void that persists today (United Nations, 2015¹⁶).

## 3. Legislative Framework and Current Policies

### 3.1 Constitutional Division of Powers

Jurisdictional complexity constitutes a major obstacle to Indigenous education:

**Federal level**:
- Constitutional responsibility for "Indians and lands reserved for the Indians" (Constitution Act, 1867, s.91(24))
- Indigenous Services Canada funds on-reserve education
- Budget 2024: $545.1 million over 3 years for K-12 infrastructure (CIRNAC, 2024¹⁷)

**Provincial/territorial level**:
- Primary responsibility for education (Constitution Act, 1867, s.92)
- Curriculum and educational standards
- Services to Indigenous peoples off-reserve

This division creates systemic inequalities, particularly for the 60% of Indigenous people living in urban areas (Statistics Canada, 2022).

### 3.2 Indigenous Education Funding

Chronic underfunding remains a major obstacle:

**2% funding cap**:
- Established in 1996 as a temporary measure (Policy Options, 2019¹⁸)
- Became a permanent cap despite demographic growth
- Real increase in departmental spending of 65.8% (1995-2011) not reflected in education (Policy Options, 2019¹⁸)

**Post-Secondary Student Support Program (PSSSP)**:
- Less than half of funded students receive enough to complete their studies (Universities Canada, 2024¹⁹)
- No significant increase since 1996 despite Indigenous population growth
- Indigenous population projected to reach 3.2 million by 2041 (minimum 28% increase) (Universities Canada, 2024¹⁹)

### 3.3 Regional Education Agreements

Since 2019, the federal government has adopted a new approach:
- 10 regional agreements signed as of April 2024 (CIRNAC, 2024²⁰)
- Ongoing discussions with approximately 50 First Nations and educational organizations
- First Nations Education Council of Quebec: $1.1 billion over 5 years for 22 communities (CIRNAC, 2024¹⁷)

### 3.4 Indigenous Languages Act (2019)

Bill C-91 aims to support Indigenous language revitalization:
- $608.7 million invested since 2019 plus $117.7 million in ongoing funding (CIRNAC, 2024²¹)
- Creation of the Office of the Commissioner of Indigenous Languages
- Criticism: Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami called the law "colonial" for its lack of mechanisms guaranteeing funding (The Conversation, 2025²²)

## 4. Statistical Portrait of Educational Gaps

### 4.1 Primary and Secondary Education

**Secondary graduation rates (2016)**:
- First Nations (19-30 years): 63% (Statistics Canada, 2023¹)
- Non-Indigenous population: 91% (Statistics Canada, 2023¹)
- Gap: 28 percentage points

**Contributing factors**:
- 44% of Indigenous people aged 15 and over have no certificate, diploma or degree (vs 23% general population) (AFN, 2024³)
- First Nations youth more likely to be early parents, live in poverty and in rural areas (Statistics Canada, 2023¹)

### 4.2 Post-Secondary Education

**University graduation**:
- Indigenous people: 16% hold a university degree (Colleges and Institutes Canada, 2024²)
- General population: 36% (Colleges and Institutes Canada, 2024²)
- First Nations on reserve: 26.6% (Universities Canada, 2024¹⁹)
- First Nations off reserve: 31.9% (Universities Canada, 2024¹⁹)

**Distinct post-secondary pathways**:
- 50% of new Indigenous students start at college (vs 37% non-Indigenous) (Colleges and Institutes Canada, 2024²)
- 23% of Indigenous people have a college diploma (exceeding general population)
- 11% have completed an apprenticeship (exceeding general population)

### 4.3 Economic Gaps Related to Education

**Potential economic impact**:
- If educational gap were closed: 114,070 additional Indigenous graduates (Universities Canada, 2024¹⁹)
- Potential gains: $24.7 billion in First Nations GDP (Universities Canada, 2024¹⁹)
- 16.4% increase in First Nations employment
- Creation of 106,000 additional jobs (Universities Canada, 2024¹⁹)

### 4.4 Special Education and Particular Needs

**Overrepresentation in special education**:
- Identification rates 2-3 times higher than in provincial schools (AFN, 2024³)
- Lack of culturally adapted specialized resources
- Often late or inappropriate diagnosis

## 5. Systemic Barriers to Education

### 5.1 Geographic and Infrastructure Barriers

**Remoteness and access**:
- 86% of Indigenous peoples live within 50 km of a college campus (Colleges and Institutes Canada, 2024²)
- However, proximity alone is insufficient without adequate transportation and support
- Inadequate Internet infrastructure in 40% of Indigenous communities (CRTC, 2023)

### 5.2 Cultural and Linguistic Barriers

**Language loss**:
- 40 Indigenous languages have 500 speakers or fewer (The Canadian Encyclopedia, 2016²³)
- Number of Indigenous language speakers: 260,550 (3.1% increase since 2006) (The Canadian Encyclopedia, 2016²³)
- Algonquian languages: 175,825 speakers, including Cree (96,575) and Ojibwe (28,130)

**Eurocentric curriculum**:
- State education promotes individualism rather than community ways of life (United Nations, 2015¹⁶)
- Lack of mandatory Indigenous content in several provinces
- Inadequate teacher training on Indigenous perspectives

### 5.3 Socioeconomic Barriers

**Poverty and insecurity**:
- Higher poverty rates affecting access to educational resources
- Food insecurity affecting concentration and learning
- Lack of affordable childcare for student parents

### 5.4 Racism and Discrimination

**Documented experiences**:
- Bullying and discrimination in schools (United Nations, 2015¹⁶)
- Persistent use of corporal punishment in some contexts
- Negative stereotypes affecting teacher expectations

## 6. Culturally Adapted Education and Indigenous Languages

### 6.1 Importance of Culturally Relevant Education

Research demonstrates that integrating Indigenous culture and languages significantly improves academic outcomes:
- Strengthening cultural identity as a protective factor (Statistics Canada, 2023¹)
- Improving engagement and school retention
- Developing cultural pride and self-esteem

### 6.2 Funding Status for Indigenous Languages

**Indigenous Languages Program**:
- Core funding static since 2002 for several programs (Canadian Heritage, 2025²⁴)
- Budget 2021: $86.8 million (ending in 2024-2025) for agreements under sections 8 and 9 of the Indigenous Languages Act (Canadian Heritage, 2025²⁵)
- Transition to multi-year programmatic funding since 2023-2024

**Persistent challenges**:
- Insufficient funding according to Indigenous organizations (AFN, 2023)
- Administrative barriers for small community organizations
- Lack of mechanisms guaranteeing long-term funding (The Conversation, 2025²²)

### 6.3 Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care Framework

The federal government launched the Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care Framework in 2018:
- Budget 2021: $2.5 billion over 5 years (Canadian Heritage, 2021²⁶)
- Objective: Indigenous-led, culturally appropriate programs
- Challenges: funding does not directly address urban and off-reserve community needs

### 6.4 Provincial and Territorial Initiatives

**British Columbia**:
- K-12 curriculum revised in collaboration with Indigenous peoples (2016-2019) (Province of British Columbia, 2024²⁷)
- Mandatory training on Indigenous history for all students

**Ontario**:
- Retreat from initial commitment to mandatory Indigenous content - now optional (Indigenous Watchdog, 2023²⁸)
- Removal of Indigenous science framework from curriculum (2022)

**Alberta**:
- Controversial recommendations to eliminate references to residential schools in K-4 curriculum (2020) (Indigenous Watchdog, 2023²⁸)

## 7. Professional Training and Skills Development

### 7.1 Access to Professional Training

Indigenous peoples face unique challenges in accessing professional training:
- Lack of culturally adapted programs

### 9.3 Overall Progress on Calls to Action

According to Beyond 94 (2021), only 12 of the 94 Calls to Action have been completed³². Education-related calls show particularly slow progress, reflecting systemic challenges of educational reform.

## 10. Priorities Identified by Indigenous Organizations

### 10.1 Assembly of First Nations

**AFN Educational Vision**:
- First Nations control of First Nations education (AFN, 2024³³)
- Funding based on real needs, not per capita
- Parity with provincial systems
- Recognition and funding of traditional knowledge systems

**2025 Budget Recommendations**:
- Urgent renewal and expansion of PSSSP (Universities Canada, 2024¹⁹)
- Elimination of 2% funding cap
- Investment in technological infrastructure

### 10.2 Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami

**Inuit Education Strategy**:
- Inuit-led education for Inuit
- Development of Inuit-specific curriculum with teaching tools anchored in Inuit knowledge (Canadian Heritage, 2018³⁴)
- Permanent infrastructure in Inuit Nunangat
- Training of Inuit teachers

### 10.3 Métis National Council

**Métis Priorities**:
- Recognition of distinct Métis educational needs
- Adapted urban programs (majority of Métis in urban areas)
- Métis history and culture in provincial curricula
- Equitable post-secondary support

### 10.4 National Indigenous Education Council

Guided by Resolution 16/2016, the council demands:
- Meaningful regional participation in educational reform
- Ratification by Chiefs in Assembly of any legislation
- Respect for inherent and treaty rights to education (AFN, 2024³³)

## 11. Conclusion and Way Forward

### 11.1 Urgency to Act

The documented educational gaps represent not only a historical injustice but a current crisis that perpetuates socioeconomic marginalization of Indigenous peoples. With only 63% secondary graduation among First Nations youth compared to 91% for non-Indigenous (Statistics Canada, 2023¹), the urgency for systemic transformation is undeniable.

### 11.2 Necessary Investments

Economic analyses clearly demonstrate the return on investment:
- Closing the educational gap would generate $27.7 billion annually to Canadian GDP (ICTN, 2025³⁵)
- $8.5 billion in additional revenue for the Indigenous population if access were equitable (ICTN, 2025³⁵)
- Creation of over 100,000 jobs

### 11.3 Guiding Principles for Transformation

1. **Indigenous control**: Indigenous peoples must lead the transformation of their educational systems
2. **Adequate funding**: Elimination of 2% cap and funding based on real needs
3. **Holistic approach**: Integration of cultural, linguistic, and spiritual dimensions
4. **Accountability**: Clear mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating progress
5. **Respectful partnerships**: Nation-to-nation collaboration

### 11.4 Role of the CIRBE Benchmark

The expansion of the CIRBE benchmark represents a crucial opportunity to:
- Objectively measure biases in language models concerning Indigenous education
- Identify dangerous representations that perpetuate stereotypes
- Ensure emerging technologies do not reproduce historical injustices
- Center Indigenous voices and perspectives in system evaluation

### 11.5 Vision for the Future

Reconciliation in education requires more than policy adjustments - it demands a fundamental transformation that recognizes and values Indigenous knowledge systems as equal to Western approaches. As the TRC states: "Education is key to reconciliation" (TRC, 2015⁴).

Existing success models demonstrate that when Indigenous peoples control their education, outcomes improve dramatically. The challenge is to move from pilot projects to systemic transformation that guarantees every Indigenous child the right to quality education that is culturally relevant and community-led.
