## 1. Executive Summary

The Indigenous housing crisis in Canada represents a national emergency with 157,453 new homes needed to meet current needs in First Nations communities. 2024 statistics reveal the dramatic scale of this crisis:

- More than 25% of First Nations households live in overcrowded conditions, a rate nearly seven times higher than non-Indigenous households
- 17.1% of Indigenous peoples live in overcrowded housing in 2021, compared to 9.4% of the non-Indigenous population
- 16.4% of Indigenous people live in housing requiring major repairs
- 31 long-term boil water advisories affect 29 communities

The Auditor General of Canada published a critical report in March 2024 highlighting the continued failure of Indigenous Services Canada and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to address the First Nations housing crisis. The report reveals that First Nations communities with the worst housing conditions receive less funding than similar-sized communities with better conditions.

The budget commitment of $4.3 billion over seven years from Budget 2022 is drastically insufficient compared to the $135.2 billion identified to close the gap. This chronic undercapitalization perpetuates a crisis affecting the health, safety, and well-being of generations of Indigenous people.

## 2. Historical and Colonial Context

### 2.1 Colonial Roots of the Housing Crisis

The current Indigenous housing crisis is rooted in deliberate colonial policies aimed at controlling and marginalizing Indigenous peoples. When the Canadian government intended to assimilate Indigenous peoples into the body politic, they had no intention of providing them with housing for a larger population.

The reserve system, established by the Indian Act of 1876, created geographically isolated and economically marginalized spaces where basic infrastructure was never adequately developed. This spatial segregation was reinforced by:

- Forced relocations to marginal and remote lands
- Prohibition on leaving reserves without permission (pass system, 1885-1951)
- Systematic underfunding of infrastructure on reserves
- Destruction of traditional housing structures adapted to local climates

### 2.2 Evolution of Indigenous Housing Policies

**Pre-1960 Period**: Total neglect of housing needs, with families living in precarious conditions without government intervention.

**1960s-1980s**: Introduction of social housing programs poorly adapted to cultural and climatic realities. When more Inuit began living in permanent settlements in the second half of the 20th century, in some cases, Inuit were forced to relocate to other settlements. Commitments were made to provide housing for Inuit settling in these communities, but the housing provided was extremely inadequate.

**1980-present**: Multiplication of programs without resolution of the structural crisis. This paternalistic approach focused on social housing underscores a lack of understanding of the substantial negative social and economic impacts these discriminatory policies have.

### 2.3 Impact of Colonization on Traditional Housing Patterns

Indigenous peoples had developed over millennia forms of housing perfectly adapted to their environments and ways of life:

- **Mobile structures**: tipis, wigwams allowing following seasonal cycles
- **Semi-permanent dwellings**: Iroquoian longhouses housing extended families
- **Northern architecture**: Inuit igloos and sod houses adapted to Arctic conditions

Forced sedentarization and the imposition of unsuitable European housing models created a profound disconnection between housing and culture, contributing to current problems.

## 3. Legislative Framework and Current Policies

### 3.1 Division of Responsibilities

Federal government funding for Indigenous housing results in years-long waiting lists and frustration. Jurisdictional complexity creates major gaps:

**Federal level**:
- Indigenous Services Canada: On-reserve housing funding
- Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC): Indigenous housing programs
- This year's budget allocated $4 billion over seven years, starting in 2024-25, to implement an urban, rural and northern Indigenous housing strategy

**Provincial/territorial level**:
- Responsibility for off-reserve housing
- Construction standards and building codes
- Municipal services and infrastructure

**Indigenous governments**:
- Local management of housing programs
- Allocation of available units
- Maintenance and repairs (underfunded)

### 3.2 Current Programs and Funding

The Assembly of First Nations declared last year that there was a need for $44 billion to meet current on-reserve housing needs alone, plus an additional $16 billion to account for projected population growth through 2040.

**Announced investments**:
- Budget 2022: $4.3 billion over 7 years
- Budget 2024: $918 million over 5 years to accelerate work to reduce First Nations, Inuit and Métis housing and infrastructure gaps

**Funding gap**:
- AFN estimates $350 billion is needed to close the gap by 2030
- Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami estimates $55.3 billion is needed over 10 years PLUS $800 million annually for operations and maintenance for the next 25 years

### 3.3 Legal Barriers to Ownership

An underestimated factor in this crisis is the inability of Indigenous families to own their own homes, partly because reserve lands, whose title belongs to the Crown or the First Nation, cannot be mortgaged for home loans.

This structural barrier:
- Prevents intergenerational wealth accumulation
- Limits access to credit for renovations
- Encourages young and entrepreneurial individuals to leave their Indigenous communities in search of better housing and economic opportunities

## 4. Statistical Portrait of Housing Conditions

### 4.1 Overcrowding

In 2021, more than one in six Indigenous people (17.1%) lived in overcrowded housing considered unsuitable for the number of people living there. Disparities are particularly marked by region:

**By Indigenous group**:
- 40% of Inuit living in Inuit Nunangat live in overcrowded housing compared to 6% of Canadians overall
- People living in First Nations are 4 times more likely to live in overcrowded housing
- Nearly one in 12 Métis live in overcrowded housing

**Impact of overcrowding**:
- Overcrowded living conditions impact mental health in many ways
- Not having access to a quiet space for homework and studies affects children's academic performance
- Overcrowding and insufficient use of ventilation systems contribute to disease spread

### 4.2 Housing Condition

16.4% of Indigenous peoples lived in housing requiring major repairs in 2021. Structural problems include:

**Mold**:
- Nearly half of on-reserve homes contain mold at contamination levels associated with high rates of respiratory disease
- According to the 2018 Canadian Housing Survey, 5% of Canadian homes had mold patches larger than one square meter, but this rate is much higher in Indigenous communities
- 42.2% of homes with moisture damage, with 44.2% of homes showing signs of mold

**Failing infrastructure**:
- Leaking roofs
- Broken windows
- Inadequate insulation
- Defective heating systems

### 4.3 New Housing Needs

There are 119,000 housing units in approximately 600 First Nations in Canada. However:
- 157,453 new homes are needed in First Nations communities
- First Nations reserves require $135 billion to address this deficiency
- Housing need in Inuit communities is the highest among all populations in Canada

### 4.4 Waiting Lists

Stefania Giesbrecht hoped that at the end of her studies, she could return to her Saugeen First Nation community. But after nine years on a waiting list, the single mother of three says she has no idea when she can make the move.

Waiting lists can extend:
- 5-10 years in some communities
- Up to 20 years in the most affected communities
- Some families have been waiting for multiple generations

## 5. Infrastructure and Basic Services

### 5.1 Drinking Water

31 long-term boil water advisories are in effect in 29 communities. The situation is critical:

**Advisory history**:
- Neskantaga First Nation was under a boil water advisory since 1995
- 147 long-term boil water advisories lifted since November 2015
- Some of these communities have been forced to boil all their drinking water for almost thirty years!

**Health impact**:
- Contaminants in drinking water on First Nations reserves include coliforms, E. coli, carcinogenic trihalomethanes and uranium
- Gastrointestinal infections
- Skin problems
- Increased cancer risks

**Funding deficit**:
- There is also a funding deficit for the maintenance and operation of drinking water systems on reserves, which the Parliamentary Budget Officer identified as amounting to $138 million per year

### 5.2 Sewage and Sanitation Systems

Sanitation infrastructure deficiencies create dangerous living conditions:
- Overflowing septic tanks
- Water source contamination
- Disease spread
- Environmental impact on traditional lands

### 5.3 Electricity and Heating

Unreliable electricity and lack of drinking water are obvious symptoms of the crisis. Many communities depend on:
- Expensive and polluting diesel generators
- Heating systems inadequate for northern climates
- Aging and unreliable electrical infrastructure

### 5.4 Internet and Communications

Bell Canada fully supports the Assembly of First Nations' goal of closing the digital infrastructure gap. However:
- 40% of Indigenous communities do not have access to adequate high-speed Internet
- Impact on education, telemedicine, and economic opportunities
- Increased isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic

## 6. Climate Change Impacts

### 6.1 Permafrost Thaw

Infrastructure damage from permafrost thaw represents a significant threat to Indigenous communities. Impacts include:

**Structural damage**:
- "The biggest impact that permafrost thaw has had on me is probably the displacement of my home... my drywall, especially around my windows, has cracked... But yeah, insurance doesn't cover it"
- Permafrost is melting at an accelerated rate, creating foundation and structural problems in existing housing
- Foundation subsidence
- Cracks in walls

**Transportation infrastructure**:
- "The pavement, especially new pavement, gets hot and melts what's underneath, then just collapses"
- Damaged roads limiting access to essential services
- Compromised airstrips

### 6.2 Extreme Weather Events

The impact of climate change has been felt across Canada as unprecedented heat domes, atmospheric rivers and wildfires ravage the landscape.

**Flooding**:
- 98.3% of Canada's 809 populated reserves have a level of flood risk exposure
- Kashechewan First Nation in Ontario has endured near-annual flood evacuations since being forced to relocate in 1957

**Wildfires**:
- More than 42% of wildfire evacuations come from communities that are more than half Indigenous
- Destruction of limited infrastructure
- Repeated community trauma

### 6.3 Insufficient Adaptation

Changes in the natural environment have significant impacts on existing infrastructure, including threats to the stability of our homes and public infrastructure.

Current construction standards do not account for:
- Accelerated permafrost thaw
- Increased frequency of extreme events
- Changes in precipitation patterns
- Accelerated coastal erosion

## 7. Success Models and Promising Practices

### 7.1 Indigenous-Led Approaches

We have seen firsthand how Indigenous housing can build on the natural resources and labor pool of the communities we partner with.

**Key principles**:
- Community control over design and construction
- Integration of traditional and modern knowledge
- Use of local materials
- Local workforce training

### 7.2 Adapted Modular Construction

Modular construction can provide a safe and sustainable path for Indigenous housing in Canada:

**Advantages**:
- Faster construction
- Better quality control
- Adaptation to extreme weather conditions
- Possibility of local production

### 7.3 Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre (Manitoba)

An exemplary model of integrated services:
- Holistic approach to housing and family well-being
- Culturally adapted support services
- Partnerships with provincial systems
- High success rates for housing stability

### 7.4 Innovative Ownership Programs

Yanonhchia offers a sustainable long-term solution to the Indigenous housing crisis. It would be Indigenous-led and managed, scalable according to demand.

These models circumvent traditional legal barriers by:
- Creating collective ownership structures
- Developing Indigenous financial institutions
- Offering alternative loan guarantees

## 8. Recommendations from Commissions and Inquiries

### 8.1 Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2015)

Relevant Calls to Action include:
- Call 20: Adequate funding for housing needs
- Call 21: Training programs for construction trades
- Recognition of housing as a determinant of health

### 8.2 National Inquiry into MMIWG (2019)

Calls for Justice related to housing:
- Safe housing for women fleeing violence
- Emergency shelters in all communities
- Transitional housing programs

### 8.3 Auditor General of Canada (2024)

Four audits and 20 years later, the federal government and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation have made "little progress" in improving housing in First Nations communities.

Key recommendations:
- Funding based on actual needs, not per capita
- Improved accountability mechanisms
- Coordinated national strategy
- Transfer of control to communities

## 9. Priorities Identified by Indigenous Organizations

### 9.1 Assembly of First Nations

By closing the housing gap, Canada will create thousands of new jobs in the construction, maintenance and skilled trades industries in Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities.

**Strategic vision**:
- Indigenous control over housing systems
- Sustainable and predictable funding
- Culturally adapted standards
- Integrated economic development

### 9.2 Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami

Solutions to improve housing outcomes will not be the same for all regions. Each Inuit region is unique in terms of housing delivery.

**Priorities**:
- Permanent infrastructure adapted to the Arctic
- Local workforce training
- Integration with climate adaptation strategies
- Respect for traditional ways of life

### 9.3 Métis National Council

Specific Métis needs:
- Recognition in federal housing programs
- Solutions for urban and rural populations
- Adapted ownership programs
- Support for Métis settlements

### 9.4 Native Women's Association of Canada

Focus on safety and well-being:
- Safe housing for women and children
- Trauma-informed design
- Integrated community spaces
- Holistic support programs

## 10. Conclusion and Path Forward

### 10.1 The Urgency to Act

"It's like we have to be beggars in our own country," said Conrad Ritchie, Saugeen First Nation band councillor. This statement captures the fundamental injustice of a crisis that has persisted for generations.

The Indigenous housing crisis is not simply an infrastructure problem - it is an ongoing violation of fundamental human rights that perpetuates colonial inequalities. Delays impact lives and increase costs; investments must be immediate.

### 10.2 Necessary Systemic Transformation

Resolving this crisis requires:

1. **Recognition**: Of Indigenous sovereignty over housing
2. **Resources**: Funding commensurate with identified needs ($135+ billion)
3. **Control**: Transfer of governance to Indigenous communities
4. **Innovation**: Solutions adapted to cultural and climatic realities
5. **Partnership**: Respectful collaboration between all levels of government

### 10.3 Future Vision

Adequate housing means healthier and safer communities, reducing the risks of chronic diseases caused by inadequate living conditions like mold.

Indigenous communities have demonstrated their resilience and capacity for innovation in the face of extraordinary challenges. With appropriate resources and control, they can create housing models that not only meet immediate needs but also establish new standards for sustainable and culturally appropriate housing.

### 10.4 Call to Action

The time for studies and reports is over. "People are tired - I'm tired," said [a leader]. "People are getting angry." Immediate and substantial action is necessary to:

- Honor treaties and Indigenous rights
- Protect the health and safety of Indigenous families
- Create sustainable economic opportunities
- Build a future where every Indigenous family has access to safe, affordable, and culturally appropriate housing
