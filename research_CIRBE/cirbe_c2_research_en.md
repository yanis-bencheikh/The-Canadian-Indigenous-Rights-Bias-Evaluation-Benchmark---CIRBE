## 1. Executive Summary

Indigenous peoples in Canada face a systemic crisis in the justice system, characterized by dramatic overrepresentation at all levels. In 2024, Indigenous people constitute 32.7% of the federal prison population while representing only 5% of the Canadian population (Canada, 2024¹; Statistics Canada, 2023²). This overrepresentation has intensified by 43% since 2010 (Office of the Correctional Investigator, 2023³).

Data reveals alarming disparities across several critical domains:

- **Police violence**: 26% of deaths related to police interventions in 2024 involved Indigenous people (Radio-Canada, 2024⁴)
- **Child protection**: 53.8% of children in foster care are Indigenous (Statistics Canada, 2024⁵)
- **Gendered violence**: Indigenous women are six times more likely to be murdered (National Inquiry into MMIWG, 2019⁶)
- **Legal aid**: Indigenous people represent up to 75% of clientele in northern territories (Department of Justice Canada, 2023⁷)

This report examines the structural causes of these disparities, including the colonial legacy of residential schools, systemic racism in institutions, and chronic underfunding of services. It also presents promising models and recommendations for systemic transformation.

## 2. Historical and Colonial Context

### 2.1 The Legacy of Residential Schools

The residential school system (1831-1996) created intergenerational trauma that continues to fuel overrepresentation in the justice system. Over 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend 139 residential schools across Canada (Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 2015⁸). Mortality rates in some institutions reached up to 25% (TRC, 2015⁸).

Documented impacts include:
- Destruction of traditional family and community structures
- Loss of languages and cultural practices
- Normalization of institutional violence
- Trauma transmitted across multiple generations (Bombay et al., 2014⁹)

### 2.2 The Sixties Scoop

Between 1960 and 1980, over 20,000 Indigenous children were removed from their families and placed in non-Indigenous homes, often abroad (Sinclair, 2007¹⁰). This policy exacerbated cultural disconnection and contributed to mental health and substance abuse problems that fuel the cycle of criminalization (Carrière, 2010¹¹).

### 2.3 Colonization and Criminalization

The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996) documented how colonial policies systematically criminalized Indigenous cultural practices¹². The prohibition of the potlatch (1884-1951) and other ceremonies created a generation of Indigenous people with criminal records for practicing their culture (Monchalin, 2016¹³).

## 3. Legislative Framework and Current Policies

### 3.1 Division of Powers

Jurisdictional complexity between federal, provincial/territorial, and Indigenous governments creates service gaps and systemic inequalities (Roach, 2019¹⁴). The federal government has constitutional responsibility for "Indians and lands reserved for Indians" under section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867¹⁵, but justice services primarily fall under provincial jurisdiction.

### 3.2 Calls to Action and Calls for Justice

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2015) issued 94 Calls to Action, several directly addressing the justice system⁸:
- Calls 25-42: Justice and reconciliation
- Call 30: Elimination of prison overrepresentation
- Call 38: Elimination of youth overrepresentation

The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (2019) added 231 Calls for Justice⁶.

### 3.3 Recent Government Initiatives

The federal government has announced several major investments:
- $8.8 billion for Jordan's Principle (Indigenous Services Canada, 2025¹⁶)
- $2.2 billion over five years for MMIWG (Budget 2021¹⁷)
- $47.8 billion over 10 years for child welfare reform (Canada, 2024¹⁸)

## 4. Statistical Portrait of Overrepresentation

### 4.1 Adult Incarceration

The most recent data reveals growing overrepresentation (Statistics Canada, 2023²; Office of the Correctional Investigator, 2024³):

**Federal Level (2023-2024)**:
- Indigenous prison population: 32.7% (43% increase since 2010)
- Indigenous women: 50% of all incarcerated women (April 2022)
- Incarceration rate: 625 per 100,000 (vs 48 for non-Indigenous)

**Provincial Level (2020-2021)**:
- Detention admissions: 31% Indigenous
- Saskatchewan: Overrepresentation index of 17.7
- Manitoba: 74% of provincial prison population

### 4.2 Indigenous Youth

Overrepresentation begins early in the system (Department of Justice Canada, 2024¹⁹):
- 46% of youth detention admissions
- 63% of admissions in Saskatchewan
- Average detention duration 30% longer

### 4.3 Documented Contributing Factors

Several studies identify systemic factors (Rudin, 2019²⁰; Clark, 2019²¹):
- Poverty: 40% of Indigenous children live in poverty
- Education: High school graduation rate 23% lower
- Housing: 18% live in housing requiring major repairs
- Intergenerational trauma: 65% of residential school survivors report impacts on mental health

### 4.4 Disparities in Prison Treatment

Indigenous inmates face harsher treatment (Office of the Correctional Investigator, 2023³):
- Parole: 22.7% (vs 35.6% for Caucasians)
- Maximum security classification: Overrepresented by 32%
- Solitary confinement: 42% of placements
- Use of force incidents: 39% (for 30% of population)

## 5. Relations with Police Services

### 5.1 Police Violence and Deaths in Custody

2024 marks a tragic record with 26% of 72 deaths related to police interventions involving Indigenous people (Radio-Canada, 2024⁴). Between 2000 and 2024, 17% of all fatal police interventions affected Indigenous people (CBC/Radio-Canada database, 2024²²).

### 5.2 First Nations Policing Program

Created in 1991, the program suffers from chronic underfunding (Public Safety Canada, 2021²³):
- Budget: $146 million for 1,321 positions
- Coverage: 450 communities (60% of on-reserve population)
- Funding: 52% federal, 48% provincial
- Failure rate: 34% (20 services dissolved out of 58 created)

### 5.3 Inquiries into Systemic Racism

Several major inquiries have documented racism in police forces:

**Thunder Bay (2018)**: The "Broken Trust" report revealed systemic failures in investigations of Indigenous deaths (Office of the Independent Police Review Director, 2018²⁴).

**Val-d'Or (2015)**: Allegations of sexual assaults by SQ police officers led to the Viens Commission (Viens Commission of Inquiry, 2019²⁵).

**Saskatoon (2004)**: The Wright inquiry into "Starlight Tours" confirmed abandonment of Indigenous people in freezing weather (Wright, 2004²⁶).

### 5.4 Training and Cultural Awareness

Despite repeated recommendations, training remains inadequate (Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, 2024²⁷):
- Only 24% of services have mandatory training
- Average duration: 2-3 days
- Content often developed without Indigenous consultation
- Documented institutional resistance

## 6. Access to Justice and Legal Aid

### 6.1 Geographic and Linguistic Barriers

Access to justice is severely limited in remote regions (Department of Justice Canada, 2023²⁸):
- 117 census subdivisions accessible only by plane
- Interpretation services available in only 23% of Northern courts
- Average delays for hearings: 6-12 months in remote communities

### 6.2 Legal Aid Usage

Indigenous people disproportionately depend on legal aid (Legal Aid Canada, 2023²⁹):
- Represent 20-25% of all clients nationally
- Over 75% in the three territories
- 77% of 47,088 identified Indigenous clients for criminal matters
- Only 22% for civil or family matters

### 6.3 Indigenous Courtwork Program

The program provides essential but underfunded services (Department of Justice Canada, 2023³⁰):
- Budget: $9.5 million (first increase since 2002)
- Staff: Over 180 counselors
- Clients served: 60,000 annually
- Communities served: 450

### 6.4 Unmet Needs

Program evaluation identifies major gaps (Department of Justice Canada, 2023³¹):
- 91% of key informants cite gaps in family justice
- 94% for information on Gladue rights
- 89% for access to specialized courts
- 87% for services in Indigenous languages

## 7. Gladue Principles and Restorative Justice

### 7.1 The Gladue Decision and Its Application

Since R. v. Gladue (1999)³² and R. v. Ipeelee (2012)³³, courts must consider systemic and contextual factors for Indigenous offenders. However, application remains uneven (Roach, 2019¹⁴):
- Only 9 Gladue courts in Ontario
- 4 First Nations courts in B.C.
- Minimal or no coverage in several provinces

### 7.2 Effectiveness of Alternative Approaches

Data demonstrates superior effectiveness (Department of Justice Canada, 2024³⁴):
- Recidivism reduction: 43% for Indigenous justice program participants
- Sentence consistency: 60% follow Gladue recommendations
- Savings: $73 million annually for justice worker program

### 7.3 Institutional Resistance

Several obstacles persist (Maurutto & Hannah-Moffat, 2016³⁵):
- Perception that Gladue doesn't apply to serious offenses
- Lack of training for judges and prosecutors
- Insufficient funding for Gladue reports
- Criticism of "ethnic justice" by some judicial actors

### 7.4 Promising Programs

**Indigenous Justice Strategy**: 197 community programs serving 100,000+ clients with 86% completion rate (Crown-Indigenous Relations, 2024³⁶).

**Treatment Courts**: 8% general recidivism reduction, up to 31% with full adherence to principles (Public Safety Canada, 2024³⁷).

## 8. Child Protection and State Interventions

### 8.1 Massive Overrepresentation

2021 statistics reveal a persistent crisis (Statistics Canada, 2024⁵):
- 53.8% of 26,680 children in foster care are Indigenous
- 52.2% increase since 2016
- 14 times more likely to be placed than non-Indigenous children
- Manitoba: 90% of children in care are Indigenous

### 8.2 Jordan's Principle

Named in memory of Jordan River Anderson, this principle aims for equitable access to services (Indigenous Services Canada, 2025¹⁶):
- 8.9 million products and services approved
- $8.8 billion in funding since 2016
- Backlog: 140,000 requests
- Growth: 614,350 requests (2021-22) to 3 million (2023-24)

### 8.3 Bill C-92 and Indigenous Jurisdiction

The Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and Métis children, youth and families (2019)³⁸:
- Confirmed constitutional by Supreme Court (2024)
- 37 groups have given notice of intent
- Only a few agreements signed
- Implementation and funding challenges

### 8.4 Historic Reform Agreement

The $47.8 billion 10-year agreement represents Canada's largest settlement (Canada, 2024¹⁸):
- $23 billion in compensation
- $24.8 billion for long-term reform
- Criticism about funding adequacy

### 8.5 Promising Models

**Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre (Manitoba)**: 98% success rate for family reunification, saving $15 million annually (CBC, 2022³⁹).

## 9. Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls

### 9.1 Scope of the Crisis

The National Inquiry (2019) qualified the violence as genocide⁶:
- Indigenous women: 16% of all female homicides
- 6 times more likely to be killed
- 11% of missing women (4.3% of population)
- 81% killed by someone they knew

### 9.2 Implementation of Calls for Justice

Of 231 Calls for Justice, only two have been fully implemented (AFN, 2024⁴⁰):
- Federal Pathway created with $2.2 billion over 5 years
- Permanent MMIWG Secretariat established
- Red Dress Alert system in development
- Progress deemed "unacceptable" by families

### 9.3 Systemic Factors

Root causes persist (Statistics Canada, 2023⁴¹):
- 42% of Indigenous women experienced violence before age 15
- Police failures in 209 of 219 testimonies
- Intersectional racism and sexism
- Economic and social marginalization

### 9.4 Funding Reductions

Concerning developments in 2024-2025 (CBC, 2024⁴²):
- End of $23.5 million funding for Northern prosecution offices
- 25% reduction in territorial offices
- Disproportionate impact on MMIWG investigations
