## 1. Executive Summary

Indigenous peoples in Canada face deep and persistent economic disparities that represent a systemic violation of their economic rights. In 2024, despite a growing Indigenous economy contributing nearly $50 billion to Canadian GDP, gaps persist in several critical areas:

- **Employment gap**: Indigenous employment rate is 50% versus 57% for non-Indigenous people, with gaps reaching up to 42 percentage points in Nunavut (Indigenous Services Canada, 2024¹; National Indigenous Economic Development Board, 2024²)
- **Wage gap**: Indigenous employees earn $0.91 for every dollar earned by non-Indigenous workers, with First Nations women off-reserve earning only $0.78 (Statistics Canada, 2024³)
- **Entrepreneurship**: Indigenous businesses represent only 1.32% of Canadian private businesses despite 5% of the population (National Indigenous Economic Development Board, 2024²)
- **Access to capital**: The majority of Indigenous communities have no bank branch, and Indian Act restrictions prevent using land as collateral (ICTINC, 2023⁴; Indigenous Watchdog, 2022⁵)

Indigenous economic development is intrinsically linked to sovereignty and self-determination. As the National Indigenous Economic Development Board states: "Economic reconciliation enables prosperity and resilience, supporting Indigenous self-determination and community priorities" (NIEDB, 2024²).

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Definition of Economic Reconciliation

Economic reconciliation represents a fundamental paradigm shift in relations between Indigenous peoples and Canada. It involves "identifying feasible ways to include Indigenous peoples in economic opportunities arising from resource development" (Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, 2024⁶), but goes far beyond to encompass complete economic self-determination.

### 2.2 Conceptual Framework

This report draws on several theoretical and legal frameworks:
- **United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)**: Article 20 on the right to economic development and Article 21 on improving economic conditions (UN, 2007⁷)
- **Truth and Reconciliation Commission Calls to Action**: Call 7 on eliminating employment gaps and Call 92 on private sector engagement (TRC, 2015⁸)
- **National Indigenous Economic Strategy**: 107 calls for economic prosperity developed by over 20 Indigenous organizations (NIEDB, 2022⁹)

### 2.3 Methodology

This report synthesizes the most recent government data, peer-reviewed academic research, and Indigenous organization reports to present a comprehensive portrait of current economic realities and pathways to transformation.

## 3. Historical and Colonial Context

### 3.1 Pre-Contact Indigenous Economies

Before colonization, Indigenous peoples possessed sophisticated and prosperous economies. As described by Manny Jules, Chief Commissioner of the First Nations Tax Commission: "We used our jurisdiction to create a public and community sector that supported many innovations in agriculture, land and resource management, products, transportation, science, mathematics and of course art" (Bank of Canada, 2022¹⁰).

### 3.2 Colonial Economic Destruction

Colonial policies systematically dismantled these prosperous economies:

**The Indian Act (1876)**:
- Section 89: Prohibition on using on-reserve property as collateral, preventing access to credit (Indigenous Watchdog, 2022⁵)
- Ban on potlatch and other traditional economic practices (1884-1951)
- Pass system limiting economic mobility until 1941

**Measurable impacts**:
- Loss of 98% of traditional lands affecting resource-based economies (Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, 1996¹¹)
- Systematic exclusion from Canadian commercial networks
- Creation of forced economic dependency

### 3.3 Contemporary Legacy

The impacts of these policies persist. As the OECD notes: "Even when Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups have the same level of education, they still do not experience the same employment success rate" (OECD, 2018¹²), demonstrating that barriers go beyond human capital.

## 4. Statistical Portrait of Economic Disparities

### 4.1 Employment and Labor Market Participation

**Employment rates by group (2021)**:
- First Nations on reserve: 19.9 percentage points below non-Indigenous rate (NIEDB, 2024²)
- First Nations off reserve: 20.3% without regular family doctor (ISC, 2024¹)
- Métis: Historically higher rates, but growing gap
- Inuit: Declining participation during pandemic, widening gap

**Temporal evolution**:
- The labor market participation gap between First Nations on reserve and non-Indigenous has increased by 22.8% since 2006 (NIEDB, 2024²)
- "A significant increase over time representing a concerning trend" (NIEDB, 2024²)

### 4.2 Income and Employment Quality

**Wage gaps (2022)**:
- Indigenous hourly average: $29.62/h vs $32.58/h non-Indigenous (Statistics Canada, 2024³)
- First Nations off reserve: $28.78/h (lowest)
- Métis: $30.38/h
- Overall ratio: $0.91 for every non-Indigenous dollar

**Gender-ethnicity intersectionality**:
Indigenous women face double discrimination, with larger wage gaps than their male counterparts or non-Indigenous women (Statistics Canada, 2024³).

### 4.3 Entrepreneurship and Business Ownership

**Entrepreneurial representation**:
- 7.4% of Indigenous people are entrepreneurs (2016), up from 6.8% (2006) (ICTINC, 2023⁴)
- Over 75,000 Indigenous businesses in Canada (OCC, 2023¹³)
- GDP contribution: $48.9 billion annually (NIEDB, 2024²)

**Business structure**:
- Majority are micro-enterprises (0-4 employees)
- Concentration in certain sectors: construction, public administration
- Under-representation in high value-added sectors

### 4.4 Indigenous Economic Growth

Despite barriers, the Indigenous economy shows remarkable resilience:
- Indigenous GDP: Growth of 74.7% (2012-2022) vs 54% for all of Canada (Statistics Canada, 2025¹⁴)
- Attributable GDP value: $81.9 billion (2012) to $97.0 billion (2020) (NIEDB, 2024²)
- Unrealized potential: Additional billions if gaps were closed

## 5. Systemic Barriers to Indigenous Entrepreneurship

### 5.1 Infrastructure and Geography

**Documented challenges**:
- Lack of reliable infrastructure: roads, airports, electricity, water (ICTINC, 2023⁴)
- Inadequate Internet: Affects e-commerce and digital economy
- Remoteness from markets: Increases transportation costs and limits supplier access

### 5.2 Stereotypes and Discrimination

Indigenous entrepreneurs face persistent prejudices:
- 46% of off-reserve Indigenous people report experiencing racism (ICTINC, 2023⁴)
- "Underlying misconceptions that Indigenous culture is counter-intuitive to good business strategies" (ICTINC, 2023⁴)
- Impact on access to business networks and mentoring opportunities

### 5.3 Language Barriers

With over 60 Indigenous languages in Canada:
- 213,400 people speak an Indigenous language at home (2011 Census¹⁵)
- Challenges navigating English/French business environment
- Lack of business services in Indigenous languages

### 5.4 Legal and Regulatory Restrictions

**Indian Act**:
- Section 89: "The inability of Indigenous entrepreneurs to use their property on reserve lands as collateral for a loan" (Global Affairs Canada, 2018¹⁶)
- Increased complexity for on-reserve commercial transactions
- Limitations on autonomous economic development

## 6. Access to Capital and Financing

### 6.1 Systemic Banking Exclusion

The situation is alarming:
- "The vast majority of Indigenous communities have no bank within their boundaries" (ICTINC, 2023⁴)
- Canada's four major banks collectively have less than 50 on-reserve branches
- Impact: Absence or poor credit scores, exacerbating financing access challenges

### 6.2 Wealth Gaps

"On average, Indigenous entrepreneurs have fewer financial resources and a smaller asset base to serve as collateral than non-Indigenous entrepreneurs" (EDC, 2025¹⁷). This intergenerational wealth disparity creates a vicious cycle of financial exclusion.

### 6.3 Financing Initiatives

**Aboriginal Entrepreneurship Program**:
- Up to $99,999 for individual entrepreneurs
- Up to $250,000 for community businesses (ISC, 2024¹⁸)
- Administered by Aboriginal Financial Institutions (AFIs)

**Recent developments**:
- $150 million Indigenous Growth Fund managed by NACCA (EDC, 2025¹⁷)
- EDC's $200 million equity support commitment (EDC, 2025¹⁷)
- Federal loan guarantee program proposed in Budget 2024 (Canada, 2024¹⁹)

### 6.4 Innovative Solutions

**Aboriginal Economic Development Corporations**:
- Circumvent certain Indian Act restrictions
- Enable access to alternative forms of financing
- Success examples in mining and energy sectors

## 7. Discrimination in the Labor Market

### 7.1 Nature and Extent of Discrimination

Discrimination persists at all levels:
- Negative assumptions during hiring
- Glass ceilings for professional advancement
- Harassment and hostile work environments

### 7.2 Non-Standard Employment and Precarity

Indigenous workers are overrepresented in non-standard employment:
- "Indigenous earnings disparities are smaller in non-standard than standard employment, [but] the relatively low earnings of many non-standard jobs are an important factor contributing to overall economic inequalities" (Lamb & Verma, 2021²⁰)
- Structural barriers preventing transition to standard employment

### 7.3 Skill Underutilization

Despite increasing education levels:
- Endemic overqualification in certain sectors
- Non-recognition of traditional skills and knowledge
- "The benefits of education do not accumulate equally for Indigenous workers" (OECD, 2018¹²)

### 7.4 Employment Sectors and Representation

**Sectoral concentration**:
- Overrepresentation: Public administration, construction, resource extraction
- Underrepresentation: Professional services, finance, technology
- Impact on average income and professional mobility

## 8. Natural Resource Revenue Sharing

### 8.1 Context and Issues

It is estimated that there are potentially $650 billion in resource projects that could be developed in Canada over the next ten years, "the majority of which will take place on traditional and treaty territories" (ICTINC, 2024²¹).

### 8.2 Current Sharing Models

**British Columbia**:
- First province to share resource revenues
- Economic and Community Development Agreements (ECDAs)
- 45% of annual forestry revenues, 40% of mining taxes and royalties (Ontario, 2024²²)

**Ontario**:
- 35 First Nations communities with sharing agreements
- Represented by Grand Council Treaty #3, Mushkegowuk Council and Wabun Tribal Council

**Specific examples**:
- Athabasca Indigenous Investments: 12% participation ($1.1 billion) in seven pipelines (RBC, 2025²³)
- Demonstration of Indigenous technical, legal and commercial capacity

### 8.3 Transformation Proposal

Dr. Don Wright's proposal suggests "a fifty-fifty division of resource revenues" with allocation to a sovereign fund for reinvestment (Resource Works, 2024²⁴). This approach could fundamentally transform the economic relationship.

### 8.4 Role of Economic Reconciliation

"Economic reconciliation is essential to Indigenous self-determination" (Canada, 2024¹⁹). Budget 2024 proposes major investments to support Indigenous participation in natural resource projects.

## 9. Success Models and Promising Practices

### 9.1 National Indigenous Economic Strategy

Developed by over 20 Indigenous organizations, the strategy includes 107 calls for economic prosperity serving as a "blueprint for the inclusion of Indigenous peoples in the Canadian economy" (EDC, 2025¹⁷).

### 9.2 Aboriginal Financial Institutions

The network of 59 AFIs across Canada:
- Culturally adapted lending
- Knowledge of local realities
- High repayment rates demonstrating viability

### 9.3 Innovative Corporate Partnerships

**Promising approaches**:
- Impact and Benefit Agreements (IBAs)
- Equity participation in major projects
- Secondments and knowledge sharing
- Leader-to-leader forums

### 9.4 Entrepreneurial Successes

**Inspiring examples**:
- SheNative Goods Inc.: Indigenous women-led business creating handbags and accessories
- Manitobah Mukluks: International recognition for traditional moccasins
- Cheekbone Beauty: Cosmetics brand focused on sustainability and Indigenous representation (Business Offers Canada, 2024²⁵)
