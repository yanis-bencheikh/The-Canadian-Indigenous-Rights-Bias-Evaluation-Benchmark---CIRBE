## 1. Executive Summary

Indigenous governance in Canada stands at a decisive moment of transformation. In 2024, relations between Indigenous governments and the Crown are characterized by significant advances but also persistent challenges that testify to the colonial legacy. Treaty rights and Aboriginal rights, commonly referred to as Indigenous peoples' rights, are recognized and affirmed in section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 and are also a key element of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, 2024¹).

The data reveals a complex situation:

- **Historic treaties**: 364 First Nations representing over 600,000 people are covered by historic treaties, but implementation remains contested (CIRNAC, 2024¹)
- **Modern treaties**: 25 modern treaties, four stand-alone self-government agreements, two sectoral education agreements and one governance agreement are currently being implemented (CIRNAC, 2024²)
- **Self-government**: Approximately 50 self-government negotiation tables across the country are active (CIRNAC, 2024³)
- **Funding**: More than $1.5 billion in funding for 27 eligible programs will be delivered to 160 First Nations via the New Fiscal Relationship Grant in 2024-25 (Indigenous Services Canada, 2024⁴)

This report examines Indigenous governance mechanisms, jurisdictional challenges between levels of government, and pathways toward genuine self-determination for Indigenous peoples.

## 2. Historical and Colonial Context

### 2.1 The Imposition of the Colonial System

The Constitution Act, 1867 established a colonial structure that persists today. Crown authority supersedes all other authority (jurisdictions) in the sphere of authority creating a jurisdiction delegated by the Crown (CAID, 2024⁵). This imposition systematically eroded pre-existing Indigenous governance systems.

### 2.2 The Indian Act and Its Impacts

The Indian Act of 1876 allowed the Department of Indian Affairs to subjugate First Nations populations, hindering their self-determination (CIRNAC, 2024²). Impacts include:

- Replacement of traditional governance structures with the band council system
- Prohibition of spiritual and cultural practices (1884-1951)
- Federal control over all aspects of First Nations life
- Creation of an imposed and unrepresentative governance system

### 2.3 The Numbered Treaties (1871-1921)

The Numbered Treaties are a series of eleven treaties signed between First Nations and the reigning monarch of Canada from 1871 to 1921 (Wikipedia, 2024⁶). These treaties:

- Cover all of Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and parts of British Columbia, Ontario, Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon
- Expanded the Dominion of Canada resulting in the displacement of Indigenous populations for vast tracts of land in exchange for promises made to Indigenous peoples in the region
- Are now criticized for their failed implementation and broken promises

## 3. Current Legislative Framework and Policies

### 3.1 Constitutional Recognition

This principle affirms the inherent right of self-government as an existing Aboriginal right within section 35. Recognition of the inherent jurisdiction and legal orders of Indigenous nations is therefore the starting point for discussions (Department of Justice Canada, 2024⁷).

### 3.2 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples

Under Article 37 of the United Nations Declaration, and consistent with Canada's Collaborative Modern Treaty Implementation Policy, it is imperative that Canada and Indigenous peoples work together to co-develop legislative and policy processes, tools and mechanisms (Department of Justice Canada, 2024⁸).

### 3.3 Collaborative Modern Treaty Implementation Policy (2023)

Canada commits to respecting its obligations under modern treaties and fully embodying genuine nation-to-nation, government-to-government and Inuit-Crown relationships with Indigenous modern treaty partners (CIRNAC, 2024⁹).

## 4. Treaty Implementation

### 4.1 Historic Treaties: Broken Promises

In 1850, Indigenous groups ceded much of what is now Northern Ontario for a promise that any wealth from the land would be shared with them. They are still waiting (The Washington Post, 2024¹⁰).

Persistent challenges include:
- The annuity has remained at 4 Canadian dollars per person, or about $3, since 1875
- The Ontario Superior Court agreed that Robinson Treaties promises had been "altogether forgotten" by the Crown
- Billions of dollars potentially owed to First Nations

### 4.2 Modern Treaties: A New Paradigm

Since 1975, when Canada signed the first modern treaty, the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, 25 modern treaties have come into effect (CIRNAC, 2024²). These treaties:

- Modern treaties are constitutionally protected agreements that are an integral part of Canada's constitutional framework and represent a distinct expression of reconciliation
- Cover more than 40% of Canada's land mass
- Include self-government provisions after 2000

### 4.3 British Columbia Negotiation Process

Treaties follow a six-step process in collaboration with the British Columbia Treaty Commission (Province of British Columbia, 2024¹¹). The process involves:

- First Nation, Canada and British Columbia at each treaty table
- Common topics at all treaty tables, such as: land rights and claims, natural resource management, environmental protection

## 5. Self-Government

### 5.1 Current State of Negotiations

Currently, there are about 50 self-government negotiation tables across the country. These tables are at various stages of the negotiation process and in many cases are negotiated jointly with modern treaties (CIRNAC, 2024³).

### 5.2 Historic Anishinabek Agreement (2022)

The Anishinabek Nation Governance Agreement is the first self-government agreement of its kind in Ontario and marks a significant step away from the Indian Act for signatory Anishinabek First Nations (Canada, 2022¹²). This agreement:

- Results from more than 20 years of negotiation
- Will recognize Anishinabek control over governance and legislative powers of signatory First Nations in key areas

### 5.3 Jurisdiction over Child and Family Services

The Supreme Court of Canada recognized that Parliament was well within its constitutional prerogatives to affirm Indigenous peoples' right to self-government and jurisdiction over child and family services (AFN, 2024¹³). This historic decision:

- First Nations will no longer be hampered by reluctant provincial partners in exercising their inherent rights, laws and jurisdictions
- Establishes that First Nations laws will prevail over conflicting provincial laws

### 5.4 Recent Developments

On November 19, 2024, negotiators from the Tłegǫ́hłı̨ Got'įnę Inc. government, Government of the Northwest Territories and Canada initialed the draft final self-government agreement (Canada, 2024¹⁴). This agreement:

- Demonstrates how all levels of government can collaborate
- Recognizing and implementing Tłegǫ́hłı̨ Got'įnę's self-determination rights is a crucial step beyond colonial governance systems

## 6. Fiscal Transfers and Funding

### 6.1 New Fiscal Relationship

The New Fiscal Relationship Grant was co-developed with the Assembly of First Nations and the First Nations Financial Management Board as an alternative funding mechanism (ISC, 2024⁴). Benefits include:

- Predictability of long-term funding through renewable terms up to 10 years
- An annual funding escalator based on inflation and population growth
- The average escalator rate in 2024-25 was 5.1%, resulting in an additional $40 million

### 6.2 Budget 2024: Promises and Realities

Budget 2024 proposes to provide $275 million over two years, starting in 2024-25 to Indigenous Services Canada to maintain Indigenous governance programs (Department of Finance Canada, 2024¹⁵). However:

- A recent report published by the AFN, titled "Closing the Infrastructure Gap," reveals that more than $349 billion is needed to meet the 2030 target (AFN, 2024¹⁶)
- This year's funding is much lower than previous Liberal budgets on Indigenous issues (Yellowhead Institute, 2024¹⁷)

### 6.3 Funding Challenges

CIRNAC obtained Treasury Board Secretariat approval to proceed with implementing the following measures starting in fiscal year 2024-25: Implementation of efficiencies and increased oversight in internal and external departmental operations (CIRNAC, 2024¹⁸). These cuts include:

- Reduction in travel
- Reduction in grants and contributions after discussions with partners
- Targeting areas that will minimize impacts on communities

## 7. Consultation and Consent (FPIC)

### 7.1 Free, Prior and Informed Consent in Canadian Legislation

References to "free, prior and informed consent" (FPIC) are found throughout the Declaration. They emphasize the importance of recognizing and upholding Indigenous peoples' rights and ensuring effective and meaningful participation (Department of Justice Canada, 2024¹⁹).

### 7.2 Practical Implementation

FPIC describes processes that are free from manipulation or coercion, informed by adequate and timely information, and that occur sufficiently before a decision so that Indigenous rights and interests can be effectively incorporated or addressed (Department of Justice Canada, 2024¹⁹).

### 7.3 Implementation Challenges

Free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) is an inherent right of Indigenous peoples and contributes to ensuring their survival, dignity and well-being (IHRB, 2025²⁰). However:

- FPIC consultation processes must allow Indigenous peoples to participate as equals and make decisions concerning their lands and territories
- Consent is not fixed or a one-time process. It can be withdrawn or reconsidered at any time

### 7.4 Examples of Tensions

The signs we see at blockades, demonstrations and on social media declaring "No pipeline without consent" speak to their perspective, objective and purpose of consultation and negotiations (Indigenous Corporate Training Inc., 2024²¹). These tensions reveal:

- Divergent interpretations of FPIC
- Conflicts between elected and hereditary authorities
- The need for more inclusive processes

## 8. Shared Jurisdictions

### 8.1 Constitutional Division of Powers

Due to the nature of the division of provincial and federal powers in the Constitution Act, 1867, policing in First Nations communities is another area of shared jurisdiction (Library of Parliament, 2024²²).

### 8.2 Health: A Jurisdictional Maze

Regarding health care for First Nations, Inuit and the Métis Nation, the federal, provincial and territorial levels share some degree of jurisdiction (ISC, 2024²³). This complexity results in:

- The Canadian health system is a complex mosaic of policies, legislation and relationships
- Service gaps due to jurisdictional disputes
- Jordan's Principle to resolve conflicts

### 8.3 Education: Toward Self-Determination

In 2021, concluded negotiations for a co-developed sectoral self-government model, the Canada-First Nations Education Jurisdiction Agreement (CIRNAC, 2024²⁴). These agreements allow:

- Legislative authority of signatory First Nations in K-12 education on reserve is recognized
- Development of their own curricula, graduation requirements, teacher certification

### 8.4 Environment: Contested Jurisdiction

Canada's Constitution does not list "environment" as a matter specifically assigned to either level of government (Library of Parliament, 2024²⁵). This ambiguity creates:

- Conflicts over resource exploitation
- Challenges for environmental protection
- The need for coordination mechanisms

## 9. Political Representation

### 9.1 National Representation

The main national organizations include:

- **Assembly of First Nations**: Represents chiefs from over 630 First Nations communities
- **Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami**: Represents the four Inuit regions
- **Métis National Council**: Represents the Métis Nation

### 9.2 Permanent Bilateral Mechanisms

Establish permanent bilateral mechanisms with First Nations, Inuit and Métis Nation leaders and the Intergovernmental Leaders Forum with modern and self-governing Indigenous government leaders (Department of Finance Canada, 2024²⁶).

### 9.3 Rights Recognition Discussion Tables

The RIRSD process was initiated in 2015 by a secret Cabinet mandate and lacks transparency, largely due to inconsistent and poorly communicated public policy principles and guidelines (AFN, 2024²⁷). Challenges include:

- Strict confidentiality requirements further disadvantage First Nations
- Lack of transparency in negotiations
- Inequality in information sharing

### 9.4 Representation in Canadian Institutions

Indigenous peoples remain under-represented in:
- Federal Parliament
- Provincial legislatures
- Judicial institutions
- Senior public service positions

## 10. Recommendations and Path Forward

### 10.1 Full Treaty Implementation

1. **Independent monitoring mechanisms**: Creation of a treaty tribunal with binding powers
2. **Adequate funding**: Allocation of resources promised in treaties
3. **Modern interpretation**: Application of treaties according to their original spirit and intent

### 10.2 Acceleration of Self-Government

1. **Simplification of processes**: Reduction of negotiation timelines currently measured in decades
2. **Legislative recognition**: Adoption of framework legislation on Indigenous self-government
3. **Transfer of jurisdictions**: Five-year plan for progressive transfer of responsibilities

### 10.3 Funding Reform

1. **Needs-based funding**: Replacement of per capita funding with a model based on real needs
2. **Long-term predictability**: Funding agreements of at least 10 years
3. **Elimination of disparities**: Parity with provincial services

### 10.4 Strengthening Representation

1. **Guaranteed seats**: Proportional representation in Parliament
2. **Council of Nations**: Creation of an Indigenous consultative upper chamber
3. **Decision-making participation**: Inclusion in all decision-making processes affecting them

### 10.5 Vision for the Future

The path to genuine reconciliation passes through full recognition of Indigenous sovereignty and equitable power sharing. As the Assembly of First Nations affirms: Creating flexible and principled approaches to negotiate outstanding First Nations land rights is imperative (AFN, 2024²⁷).
